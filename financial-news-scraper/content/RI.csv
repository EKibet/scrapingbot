The financial sector reclaimed its position as the No. 1 wealth creator while public sector undertakings recorded their worst performance in 2016-21, the Motilal Oswal 26th Annual Wealth Creation Study showed. The financial sector was both the top wealth creating and top wealth destroying sector.  Equity was the biggest wealth creating asset class of the year as stock markets the world over created history by reaching record highs. The market-capitalisation of most companies and benchmark indices skyrocketed, first-time investors got attracted to the stock markets, and unprecedented liquidity was available in the market.  Adani Transmission emerged as the fastest wealth creator and Adani Enterprises the best all-round wealth creator.  Motilal Oswal found that the Top 100 companies in India&rsquo;s equity markets created Rs 71 lakh crore in wealth during the five years from 2016 to 2021. This was the highest wealth created in the past 26 five-year periods. The pace of wealth creation was also robust at a compound annual growth rate of 24 percent vis-&agrave;-vis 14 percent for the BSE Sensex.  The previous best period in terms of wealth creation was 2014-19, when the markets generated Rs 49 lakh crore of wealth for investors. The five-year period of 2015-20 was impacted by the pandemic and created Rs 21 lakh crore of investor wealth.  The Motilal Oswal 26th Annual Wealth Creation Study, 2021, was released on December 15. The firm&rsquo;s wealth creation study was commissioned by Raamdeo Agrawal, chairman of Motilal Oswal Group.  Reliance rules the roost  Reliance Industries, the largest Indian company by market capitalisation, smashed all records to emerge as the largest wealth creator for the third time in a row. It added Rs 9.7 lakh crore to investor wealth, beating its own previous record of Rs 5.6 lakh crore during 2014-19. The company accounted for 13.6 percent of the total wealth created during the period.  &ldquo;Reliance&rsquo;s re-emergence as the biggest wealth creator reflects the power of phygital &ndash; physical plus digital,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said in the report. &ldquo;Its oil-to-chemicals and retail businesses are strongly rooted in the physical whereas the telecom business is the digital dimension. Going forward, expect more and more phygital and digital companies to spearhead wealth creation.&rdquo;  IT giant&nbsp;Tata Consulting Services&nbsp;came in second by creating wealth of Rs 7.3 lakh crore, followed by&nbsp;HDFC Bank,&nbsp;which added Rs 5.2 lakh crore,&nbsp;Hindustan Unilever&nbsp;Rs 3.4 lakh crore and Infosys Rs 3.3 lakh crore.  Bajaj Finance,&nbsp;ICICI Bank,&nbsp;HDFC,&nbsp;Kotak Mahindra Bank&nbsp;and&nbsp;HCL Technologies&nbsp;made up the remaining top 10 wealth creators for 2016-21.  Reliance also made its entry into the list of top 10 fastest wealth creators, an area which is ruled predominantly by mid and small cap companies.  Adani Group &ndash; fastest in the race  The study found Adani Transmission&nbsp;was the fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 93 percent during 2016-21. Another Adani Group company &ndash;&nbsp;Adani Enterprises&nbsp;&ndash; was ranked the third fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 86 percent, behind&nbsp;Deepak Nitrite,&nbsp;which had a price CAGR of 90 percent.  Tanla Platforms&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ruchi Soya&nbsp;were the other two companies in the top five fastest wealth creators.  A sum of Rs 10 lakh invested equally in 2016 among the top 10 fastest wealth creators would have grown to Rs 170 lakh in 2021, which is a CAGR of 77 percent compared with 14 percent for the Sensex, according to the study.  &ldquo;For high wealth creation, it is essential to pick small-to-mid companies with robust earnings growth prospects trading at reasonable valuations,&rdquo; the study highlighted.  Adani Enterprises also emerged as the most consistent wealth creator in the past five years with the highest price CAGR of 86 percent.  Sectoral Participation  The financial sector emerged as the biggest wealth creating sector during 2016-21 by generating Rs 17.4 lakh crore. The sector lost its numero uno position last year to consumer &amp;amp;amp; retail, which came in at third position this year with Rs 12.5 lakh crore. Technology occupied the second position by adding Rs 15.2 lakh crore.  Oil &amp;amp;amp; gas and metals &amp;amp;amp; mining made up the remaining list of top five biggest wealth creating sectors.  Led by rapid adoption of cloud, transformation and digitisation, the technology sector is witnessing robust demand and a strong deal pipeline, which will lead to high growth for the sector.  &ldquo;It is the only sector which may potentially challenge the dominance of the financial sector in the next wealth creation study period, 2017-2022,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said.  PSUs lose the plot  Public sector undertakings (PSUs) came up with their worst performance in the wealth creation process in 2016-21. Only Gujarat Gas&nbsp;and&nbsp;Indraprastha Gas could make it to the top 100 wealth creators, generating less than 1 percent of the total wealth.  The previous period of 2015-20, there were seven PSUs in the top 100, with 3 percent of the total wealth created. The study also found out that there were five PSUs in the top 10 wealth destroying companies. Private banks were the top wealth creators while public sector banks made up the top wealth destroyers.  Digital &ndash; the way to go  The wealth creation report highlighted that digital will be the mantra of the future.  &ldquo;Globally, value is migrating from atoms (businesses dealing in physical matter) to bits (businesses that are digital in nature),&rdquo; the report said. &ldquo;This has already played out in a big way in the US.&rdquo;  The digital ecosystem in India is right for atoms-to-bits to play out here, it said.  According to the report, bits deal in intangible assets, have very low cost of replicating their products, and benefit from network effects.  &ldquo;As a result, bits can scale up very rapidly compared to their atom counterparts,&rdquo; the report added.  Bits have high initial losses and their success depends on hyper growth, operational scalability, large opportunity size, favourable unit economics, wide distribution and network effects.

The retail business saw strong recovery and performed well.,"Reliance Industries' (RIL) September quarter results (Q2FY22) are broadly in line with analysts' estimates, and have even outperformed on some parameters. The company&rsquo;s consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) increased by 11 percent vis-&agrave;-vis the June quarter (Q1FY22) to Rs 26,020 crore. This represents a 37 percent year-on-year (YoY) EBITDA growth.  Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a report on October 22, &ldquo;RIL's Q2 EBITDA was in line with Jefferies estimates (JEFe) on beat in Retail, in line O2C and miss in Jio.&rdquo; O2C refers to RIL&rsquo;s oil-to-chemical segments.  The broker further added, &ldquo;EBITDA was up 11 percent quarter-on-quarter with Jio 1&nbsp;percent below JEFe, Reliance Retail (RR) 6&nbsp;percent ahead of JEFe and O2C in line with JEFe.&rdquo;  With the restrictions easing after the second covid-19 wave, the retail business saw a strong recovery. RIL&rsquo;s Q2 retail revenues have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Core retail revenue growth stood at 16 percent YoY. The business saw a meaningful improvement in store operating hours to 89 percent in September versus 38 percent in June.  Footfalls have recovered to 78 percent of pre-pandemic levels compared to 46 percent in Q1. The company saw strong growth in fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle with record quarterly sales in apparel &amp;amp;amp; footwear category. New stores added in Q2 stood at 813, which is far higher than 123 stores added in Q1.  On the other hand, Reliance Jio&rsquo;s performance was a tad underwhelming. The firm saw a churn of low-end subscribers owing to the pandemic&rsquo;s impact, driving a net decline of 11.1 million in customer base in Q2. &ldquo;A repeat of Jio's Q2 subscriber performance in Q3 will definitely dampen hopes of a tariff hike over the next few quarters.  For now, we will closely watch the JioPhone Next launch and its impact on Jio's net subscriber additions,&rdquo; said Jefferies&rsquo; analysts in another report. To an extent, better ARPU (average revenue per user) compensated for the subscriber performance. In Q2, ARPU stood at Rs 143.6 per subscriber per month, representing a 3.7 percent growth over previous quarter.  Centrum Broking Ltd analysts said in their first cut note, &ldquo;Retail and Telecom now forms approx. 48 percent of consolidated EBITDA versus around 32/40 percent in FY20/21. With the continued reopening across the country from June driving a strong return to normalcy H2FY22 will see much stronger numbers from both these segments, in our opinion.&rdquo;  Meanwhile, RIL&rsquo;s O2C business performance was decent last quarter. Revenues grew 58 percent YoY mainly on account of better realizations driven by the increase in oil prices and higher volumes. O2C EBITDA increased by around 44 percent year-on-year and 4 percent sequentially.  Overall, RIL&rsquo;s profit after tax (PAT) in Q2 increased by 46 percent YoY and 12 percent quarter-on-quarter. Centrum Broking&rsquo;s analysts said, &ldquo;RIL adjusted consolidated EBITDA/ PAT at Rs 26000 crore/ Rs 15500 crore, beat Centrum&rsquo;s estimated EBITDA/ PAT of Rs24800 crore/ 14600 crore as retail revived strongly with higher margins (retail EBIT +66&nbsp;percent quarter-on-quarter).&rdquo;  Ahead of the results announcement on Friday, the RIL stock closed marginally higher at Rs 2,627.40 per share on the National Stock Exchange. Some analysts expect the growth outlook to be strong. JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd expects a strong free cash flow generation phase with major capex completed and strong 17-18&nbsp;percent earnings per share CAGR likely over the next three-five years. CAGR is the compound annual growth rate.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

All businesses&nbsp;recorded growth over pre-Covid levels with the digital services segment having a record quarterly business in Q2.  Profit in the year-ago period was at Rs 10,602 crore and Rs 13,806 crore in June 2021 quarter. The sequential growth in profit was 12.1 percent.  Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at Rs&nbsp;1.74 lakh crore, significantly higher by 49.8 percent compared to Rs 1.16&nbsp;lakh crore reported in the year-ago period, said Reliance Industries in its BSE filing, adding the topline growth on a sequential basis was 20.6 percent.  &amp;quot;Reliance has posted a strong performance in Q2FY22. This demonstrates the inherent strengths of our businesses and the robust recovery of the Indian and global economies. All businesses reflect growth over pre-Covid levels,&amp;quot; said Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani in a statement.  He further said the operational and financial performance reflected a sharp recovery in the retail segment and sustained growth in oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and digital services business.  &amp;quot;O2C business benefited from sharp recovery in demand across products and higher transportation fuel margins. Reliance Retail continues to grow on the back of rapid expansion of both physical stores and digital offerings resulting in healthy growth in revenues and margin expansion,&amp;quot; Ambani added.  He said Jio, the digital services business, continued to transform the broadband market in India and set new benchmarks for the industry.  The standalone profit of the company grew by 44.1 percent to Rs 9,228 crore and gross revenue increased by 68.8 percent to Rs 1.08 lakh crore YoY in Q2.  The operating performance was also strong during the quarter, with record consolidated EBITDA at Rs 30,283 crore for the quarter, growing 30 percent YoY.  Jio Platforms  The telecom business reported quarterly operating revenue at Rs 19,777 crore, a growth of 15.1 percent YoY (adjusted for interconnection usage charge&nbsp;or IUC), driven by continued subscriber traction in the connectivity business, with&nbsp;average revenue per user (ARPU) at Rs 143.6 per subscriber per month, which is a healthy 3.7 percent growth over previous quarter.  Jio, which continued to hold the top position in 4G coverage and availability, had a customer base of 429.5 million at the end of September 2021, a net addition of 23.8 million customers YoY.  Its net profit grew by&nbsp;a massive 23.5&nbsp;percent YoY to Rs 3,728 crore and EBITDA increased by 16.6 percent to Rs 9,294 crore in the quarter ended September 2021.  Retail Business  Reliance Retail&nbsp;delivered strong performance with revenue from operations growing 9.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 39,926 crore in September 2021 quarter which saw robust growth across all consumption baskets led by strong revival in consumer&nbsp;sentiments amid festivities, relaxations in Covid related curbs and vaccinations.  &amp;quot;The business re-established growth momentum in fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle with sales closing above pre-Covid levels. Consumer electronics and grocery maintained strong growth momentum,&amp;quot; the company said.  Retail business profit for the quarter at Rs 1,695 crore grew by 74.2 percent, with&nbsp;EBIDTA growth of 45.2 percent YoY at Rs 2,913 crore, driven by favourable revenue mix, and continued focus on cost management and investment income, said the company, adding&nbsp;EBITDA margin expanded by 180 bps&nbsp;YoY driven by strong operating leverage.  Oil-To-Chemicals Business  The O2C business sustained growth momentum, registering a&nbsp;58.1 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.2 lakh crore&nbsp;primarily due to improved realisation on the back of increase in oil prices and higher volumes.&nbsp;Refinery throughput increased by 11.8 percent YoY to 17.1 MMT (million metric tonnes)&nbsp;during the quarter.  Crude prices were lifted higher by tighter supply amid multiple production outages, lowering in uptick&nbsp;of Covid infections and higher overall throughput.&nbsp;Brent crude averaged $73.5&nbsp;a barrel in Q2FY22, up by $4.6&nbsp;QoQ and&nbsp;$30.5 YoY).  Reliance said O2C business EBITDA improved by 43.9 percent YoY to&nbsp;Rs&nbsp;12,720 crore primarily on account of better transportation fuel cracks, higher intermediates product deltas, efficient product placement and yield management. However, &amp;quot;EBITDA margin for the quarter declined by 100bps YoY to 10.6 percent due to base effect driven by higher feedstock and product prices,&amp;quot; it noted.  Solar Energy Business  Reliance Industries has increased its focus on solar energy segment as it is going to establish and enable up to 100 GW of solar energy in India by 2030, and become a global player in the renewable industry.  &amp;quot;We continue to make steady progress in accelerating foray into new energy and new materials business. Our partnership approach and the desire to bring India to the forefront of global transition to clean and green transition is underscored by recent investments in some of the best companies in the world in the solar and green energy space,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  &amp;quot;I am now even more confident of achieving ambitious target of Net Carbon Zero by 2035,&amp;quot; he added.  Recently its subsidiary Reliance New Energy Solar (RNESL) acquired 86,887 series C preferred shares of Germany's NexWafe GmbH at a price of EUR 287.73 per share for 25 million euros. NexWafe is developing and producing monocrystalline silicon wafers.

The Reliance stock price hit a record high of Rs 2,750 on the BSE on October 19, with a market capitalisation of almost Rs 18.3 lakh crore. The stock had a strong run-up recently after the company signed several deals in the solar energy business. It has gained 24 percent since the beginning of July.  The September quarter earnings, to be declared on October 22, will likely decide the direction of the stock price.  Experts said Reliance&rsquo;s retail and digital businesses, which accounted for 32.4 percent and 18.5 percent of total revenue, respectively, could be the stars in the September quarter, driving double-digit growth in every earnings parameter.  &ldquo;Retail and digital business will post a strong recovery,&rdquo; Motilal Oswal said in its earnings preview. The brokerage, which has a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; call on the stock, expects consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) growth of 24 percent YoY, driven by the retail and digital businesses, and revenue growth of 34 percent YoY.  Motilal Oswal expects the oil-to-chemical segment&rsquo;s EBITDA to grow by 39 percent, Reliance Jio&rsquo;s EBITDA to increase by 21 percent, and retail EBITDA to grow by 38 percent from a year earlier.  Yes Securities expects&nbsp;Reliance to report better earnings (QoQ and YoY) on improved retail profitability and refinery margins.  The benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) was at $3.7 a barrel, the highest in the past seven quarters, improving further QoQ in Q2 of FY22, led by better gasoline, aviation turbine fuel and naphtha cracks amid hurricane-led supply disruptions, said Motilal Oswal. GRM is a measure of&nbsp;the amount that refiners earn from turning each barrel of crude oil into fuel products.  Brent crude prices averaged $73 a barrel in Q2, a jump of about 70 percent YoY and 6 percent QoQ, due to supply-side disruptions and inventory shortages. This despite OPEC+ easing production cuts starting in August. Recent hurricanes in the US have taken out more than 25 million barrels of offshore production, said Motilal Oswal.  Brent prices have been increasing and crossed $86 a barrel on October 21 for the first time since October 2018. The rally in prices is largely because of expectations of strong global growth, power outages mainly in China, and supply concerns.  Kotak, too, expects strong earnings growth at Reliance for the quarter, with consolidated profit rising 38.3 percent, EBITDA up 35.1 percent and revenue increasing 32.1 percent YoY.

","Shareholders of Reliance Industries have approved the appointment of Saudi Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan on the company board, with less than 2 per cent of votes cast against the proposal.  Disclosing the results of shareholder votes on the appointment, Reliance in a regulatory filing said 98.03 per cent of votes were cast in favour of the resolution to appoint Al-Rumayyan for three years.  As many as 10.89 crore shares or 1.96 per cent voted against the resolution, while 3.23 crore votes were declared invalid due to lack of proper authorisation, it said.  The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), a shareholder of Reliance, had last month decided to vote against the move based on US proxy advisory research firm Glass Lewis' recommendation.  CalSTRS decided to oppose the appointment due to Al-Rumayyan's position in Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) as its governor, as well as in Aramco.  PIF has already invested Rs 9,555 crore in Reliance Retail and Rs 11,367 crore in RIL's Jio Platforms. Also, Aramco is in talks to buy a 20 per cent stake in Reliance's oil-to-chemical business.  Reliance had, however, rejected conflict of interest allegations saying, &amp;quot;The appointment of Yasir Al Rumayyan has no connection with the contemplated transaction with Saudi Aramco&amp;quot;.  The O2C business of RIL is being spun off to a subsidiary.  &amp;quot;As per the terms of the proposed transaction, Saudi Aramco will participate in the equity of the O2C subsidiary. The O2C subsidiary board may have nominees of Saudi Aramco to protect its interest,&amp;quot; it added.  As of June 30, 2020, CalSTRS held 5.3 million fully and partly paid shares of RIL, according to its website. CalSTRS is America's second-largest public pension fund with assets totalling approximately USD 318.4 billion as of August 31, 2021.  CalSTRS's opposition was based on a report by Glass, Lewis &amp;amp;amp; Co, an American proxy advisory services company. According to Glass, Lewis &amp;amp;amp; Co, since Al-Rumayyan has a key role in the operations of Aramco and PIF, he does not qualify to be an independent director.  Under Indian law, an independent director cannot have a role in any company that has a business or equity partnership with the firm that intends to appoint him or her.

Of these, more than 50 have already begun including Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, an initiative of Geneva-based WEF, in their mainstream financial and regulatory reporting. These include PayPal, PwC, Petronas, S&amp;amp;amp;P, Salesforce, Total and Yara International.  The 'stakeholder capitalism metrics' initiative of the WEF, which describes itself as an international organisation for public-private cooperation, seeks to improve the ways that companies measure and demonstrate their performance against ESG (environmental, social and governance) indicators and to enable positive contributions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The project's twin objectives are to accelerate convergence among the leading private ESG standard-setters and to bring greater comparability and consistency to the reporting of ESG disclosures.  During its ongoing Sustainable Development Impact Summit, the WEF said that the international support is growing for the stakeholding capitalism metrics initiative with more than 50 companies having begun reporting these metrics in their 2020-2021 filings, while over 100 have shown support for this initiative so far.  The summit brings together global leaders from business, government, and civil society under the theme 'Shaping an Equitable, Inclusive and Sustainable Recovery'.  Those having committed to such reporting include Accenture, Allianz, Bank of America, Dell, Deloitte, EY, HEINEKEN, IBM, Mahindra Group, Mastercard, Nasdaq, Nestle, Reliance Industries, UBS, Unilever and Wipro.  Drawn from existing standards, the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics provide a set of metrics that can be reported on by all companies, regardless of industry or region, the WEF said.  The metrics also offer comparability, which is particularly important for informing ongoing efforts to create a systemic, globally accepted set of common standards for reporting on sustainability performance.  &amp;quot;We are delighted to see so many companies joining this effort and, even more so, excited to see many already implementing the metrics into their reporting,&amp;quot; WEF Managing Director Olivier Schwab said.  &amp;quot;This is the first time we have publicly seen this breadth of data from global companies across sectors on ESG factors. The Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics are already demonstrating that consistent and comparable ESG reporting can help articulate to stakeholders the collective contribution of ESG commitments,&amp;quot; Schwab added.  An early analysis of reports already incorporating the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in mainstream reporting demonstrates that it is now easier to consistently measure individual company progress against critical ESG areas, as well as the collective impact of those companies committed to reporting the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.  An initial analysis of the first 45 reports from companies shows how companies are building skills for the future, with over USD 1.5 trillion invested in training.  They also indicate that companies are innovating for better products and services, with over USD 20 trillion spent on R&amp;amp;amp;D and USD 23 trillion in cumulative multi-year innovation investments. They are also contributing to their communities and social vitality with nearly USD 140 trillion in taxes.  The WEF said companies have also faced some challenges reporting on the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics. These include data accessibility, jurisdictional challenges and data-processing capabilities.  Despite these challenges, corporate support for ESG reporting and the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics initiative continues to grow and the Forum will continue to invite all of its partners to join this initiative, it added.

Bhupender Yadav ji,&nbsp; Hon&rsquo;ble Minister of Power and New &amp;amp;amp; Renewable Energy Shri Raj Kumar Singh ji, Hon&rsquo;ble Minister of Science and Technology Shri Jitendra Singh ji,&nbsp; Member Energy NITI Aayog Dr. V K Saraswat,&nbsp; Former Executive Director International Energy Agency, Mr. Nobuo Tanaka Chairman Greenstat India, Mr. Sturle Pedersen Other distinguished dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen,  Good morning to all of you.  It is my privilege to deliver the inaugural address at the International Climate Summit - 2021 before this august audience.  I am delighted to see that this conference is bringing together leading policymakers, industrialists, investors, and scientists to discuss climate change and clean energy.  This Summit is taking place against the backdrop of a historic announcement by our beloved Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji on August 15.  In his address to the nation on the 75th Independence Day, he launched the Green Hydrogen Mission for India.  The fact that he chose &ldquo;Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav&rdquo; to make this announcement has sent a powerful message to both Indians and the rest of the world.  In my view, the message is two-fold:  One, India is determined to achieve azadi from dependence on fossil energy and become atma-nirbhar in New and Renewal Energy.  Two, India will make its fullest contribution to the global effort for achieving the goals and targets of Climate Action.  Dear Friends,  Climate Change is undoubtedly the most daunting challenge facing human civilisation today. The world is witnessing with alarming frequency the disastrous effects of global warming. Glaciers are retreating. Mean sea level is rising.  Extreme and unpredictable weather changes are becoming regular. Ecological damage is becoming stark. Indeed, Climate Change, if uncontrolled, can threaten the very existence of life on our planet. Therefore, it is not enough to make our economies carbon neutral. The world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions as soon as possible.  We have only one option: rapid transition to a new era of green, clean and renewable energy. Because Climate Change is a global problem, the clean energy transition calls for the widest possible global cooperation in technology development, investments and fair market access.  Ladies and gentlemen,   While this clean energy transition is a global imperative, it is important for India for another reason. Most of our present energy demand is met by imported fossil fuels costing us 160 billion USD every year.&nbsp; Although India&rsquo;s per capita energy consumption and emissions are less than half the global average, we are the world&rsquo;s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.  India&rsquo;s energy needs will increase exponentially as our economic growth accelerates to fulfil the aspirations of 1.38 billion people. How do we increase our energy production while drastically reducing our carbon emission content?  Both India and the world are thus facing an unprecedented challenge. However, every challenge in human history has come with an opportunity to move to the next level of progress.  Dear Friends,  I am convinced that Climate Change is an opportunity for human civilisation to renew itself in the 21st century&hellip; An opportunity to create a healthier, happier, more secure and more resilient future for the human race&hellip;  A future in which there will be greater harmony between Man and Mother Nature. This opportunity for civilizational renewal will be realised by New and Renewable Energy. If Old Energy created the problem of Climate Change, New Energy will provide a reliable solution to Climate Mitigation.  As a matter of fact, a New GREEN REVOLUTION has already begun in India. The Old Green Revolution made India self-reliant in food production. The New Green Revolution will help make India self-sufficient in energy production.  It is a matter of great pride for all of us that India has now achieved a major milestone of 100 gigawatts installed renewable energy. India is today among the top three most attractive destinations for Renewable Energy.  The target of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by December 2022 is now well within sight. &nbsp;The entire world will applaud India&rsquo;s singular achievement under the leadership of our Honourable Prime Minister.  Dear Friends,  I take this opportunity to share with you my perspectives on how India can become a global leader in Green Energy Revolution in the years to come. The Indian subcontinent is truly blessed by Soorya Deva, Vayu Deva and other gods with abundant renewable energy resources.&nbsp; Taking advantage of over 300 sunny days in a year, India can easily generate over 1,000 GW of solar energy on just 0.5% of our land.  Solar is perfectly suited to decentralised energy production, which in turn can promote decentralised socio-economic development. By investing in smart, two-way grids, micro-grids, efficient storage solutions and smart meters, we can enable individuals, communities and neighbourhoods to become both consumers and producers of energy.  These installations can be located close to demand. They have low maintenance requirements.&nbsp; Importantly, they have little environmental impact and entail zero human displacement problems. The rapid fall in the cost of production has made solar energy highly competitive, attracting large-scale investments.  This shall play a key role in ensuring similar growth trends in &ldquo;Green Hydrogen&rdquo; &ndash; the future replacement of fossil fuels. Green Hydrogen is a zero-carbon energy. It is the best and cleanest source of energy, which can play a fundamental role in the world&rsquo;s decarbonisation plans. Green hydrogen is key to our ever green, sustainable and prosperous future of everyone on the planet  Hydrogen has high gravimetric energy density and can be reconverted into electricity and heat with zero emissions. Although the costs of hydrogen from electrolysis today are high, they are expected to fall significantly in the coming years.  New technologies are emerging for hydrogen storage and transportation, which will dramatically reduce the cost of distribution. Furthermore, the Government of India is planning to create an enabling Green Hydrogen eco-system in the country. Because of all these developments, Green Hydrogen will surely attract significant investments.  Dear Friends,  Reliance Industries is fully committed to realising the vision of our Hon&rsquo;ble Prime Minister to fuel India&rsquo;s Green Economy using clean energy. Last year I had announced our ambitious commitment to make Reliance a net carbon zero company by 2035.  This year, I presented our strategy and roadmap for the New Energy Business, which will be the next big Value Creation Engine for Reliance and India. We have started developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex over 5,000 acres in Jamnagar.  It will be amongst the largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world. This complex will have four Giga Factories, which cover the entire spectrum of renewable energy. The first will be an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory. The second will be an advanced energy storage battery factory. &nbsp;The third will be an electrolyser factory for the production of Green Hydrogen.  The fourth will be a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power. Over the next three years we will invest 75,000 crore rupees in these initiatives.&nbsp; Reliance will thus create and offer a fully integrated, end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem to India and Indians.  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has set the goal to reach 450GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Out of this, Reliance will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy by 2030.&nbsp; This will create a pan-India network of kilowatt and megawatt scale solar energy producers who can produce Green Hydrogen for local consumption.  This will bring enormous benefits and prosperity to rural India. Efforts are on globally to make Green Hydrogen most affordable fuel option by bringing down its cost to initially under USD 2 per kg.&nbsp; Let me assure you all that Reliance will aggressively pursue this target and achieve it well before the turn of this decade.  And India has always set and achieved even more audacious goals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Am sure that India can set even more aggressive target of achieving under USD 1 per kg within a decade. This will make India the first country globally to achieve $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade &ndash; the 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen.  India has achieved several goals that seemed impossible over the years. I am sure this 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen will also be achieved by our talented young entrepreneurs, researchers and innovators.  Respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji,  You are the architect of a New India. Your vision of New India is propelled by New and Renewable Energy. It will create millions of new and high-value green jobs for our youth. It will give a big boost to green enterprises in India, who can proudly proclaim: &ldquo;Made in India, by India, for India and for the world!&rdquo;.  It will transform India from a large Importer of Fossil Energy to a large Exporter of Clean Energy solutions. It will also bridge the green energy divide in India and globally. I am certain that, under your dynamic leadership, India will present to the world a template of a Green Economy Movement, which will truly be a People&rsquo;s Movement.  On behalf of all my colleagues in the Indian industry, on behalf of Reliance and on my own behalf, I pledge full support and commitment to your vision and mission.  Thank you.  &nbsp;Disclaimer:&nbsp;&nbsp;Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Aimed at taking on the likes of the other video conferencing apps like Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams, JioMeet was launched in 2020. This was during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic that has been terrorising the world and most, if not all countries had issued lockdowns and public restrictions to contain the spread of the virus.  At the recently-concluded AGM, the sheer number of virtual attendees at more than 3.8 lakh proves the scalability of the app when it comes to conferencing. A statement released by Reliance reads, &ldquo;It was a proud moment for the team JioMeet to have successfully completed an event of this scale. This reemphasized on the world class engineering which has gone in making JioMeet so scalable and flexible.&rdquo;  The statement further adds, &ldquo;JioMeet is already one of India&rsquo;s most favorite video conferencing app with HD quality Audio and Video and how it has been built for Indian conditions. JioMeet has made huge in-roads into both retail and enterprise segments.&rdquo;  JioMeet has also been undergoing upgrades and has been adding features to better suit a conferencing environment in India. For example, along with a classroom and whiteboard mode, there is support for the Hindi language as well as support coming in the form of Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada.  The JioMeet app is available on all platforms like Android and iOS as well as Mac, Windows and even for Set Top Boxes and has support for VC room connectivity.

It gives me great pleasure to greet you all at the 44th Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries Limited.  It is the second year in a row that I miss the intimacy and warmth of face-to-face interaction with you, because of the COVID pandemic. However, the virtual format has enabled several lakhs of our shareholders to participate in the AGM from the safety of their homes.  Friends,  We are in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. Its scale, severity and geographical spread are unseen in a century. It has filled the hearts of all Indians with enormous pain and grief.  Several of our employees and shareholders have borne the brunt of this pandemic. Within our one large Reliance Family, the suffering of any member becomes suffering of all.  Today, Nita, I, and my colleagues on the Board offer our heartfelt condolences to all those in our Reliance Family who have lost their loved ones to this pandemic.  I now request that all of us observe a minute of silence in memory of the departed souls.  Esteemed shareholders,  The Company's accounts for the year ended March 31, 2021 have already been circulated to you. With your permission, I would like to take them as read.  Our business performance and financial success since the last AGM have exceeded our expectations, despite the pandemic. But I shall come to that later in my address.  What has given me far greater happiness than our business performance is Reliance's humanitarian efforts during these exceedingly difficult times. I feel both proud and humbled to share with you that throughout the COVID crisis, our Reliance Family has risen to the occasion with a sense of purpose and national duty. Our entire organisation has become energised with the spirit of service.  Every single employee has participated &ndash; directly or indirectly &ndash; in the Fight against COVID and become a Goodwill Ambassador of Reliance.  I am sure our efforts of the last one year would have made our Founding Chairman, Shri Dhirubhai Ambani, proud, because, the one common, unifying thread that runs through everything we have ever done at Reliance is the spirit of CARE and EMPATHY.  WE CARE for our Employees and their Families. WE CARE for our Customers, our Shareholders, and our Partners. WE CARE for the Country and the Community.  WE CARE for the Planet and the People.  This is what the true Reliance spirit was, is, and will always be. I now invite Isha, Akash and Nita to tell us about our COVID Missions of Reliance and the wonderful work done by all our colleagues.  1. Reliance Foundation and COVID Care  ISHA: Good afternoon everyone. I am Isha Ambani. AKASH: And I am Akash Ambani.  ISHA: Last AGM we were hopeful that by this time this year, the pandemic would be behind us. And yet, this is the second time that we are meeting virtually.These have been difficult times. But we have come together as a country, as a society, and as One Reliance family, to rise above them.  AKASH: Despite the challenges we have faced, when we look back at the year &ndash; we feel humbled &amp;amp;amp; inspired that each and every person in our Reliance family went out of their way to help one another, much beyond the call of duty.  ISHA: We know that had our grandfather been with us today, he would be proud. This is the Reliance he always wanted to see. One where each person did their very best to help those in need, and to be of service to our communities and our country.  Many of our Reliance family members have fought this battle from the frontlines - our retail store workers, telecom engineers, doctors, nurses, hospital staff. We have the deepest gratitude and highest admiration for each and every one of them.  AKASH: They ensured, our nation's fuel supplies are intact, digital connectivity is unaffected and daily essential needs of millions of people are met safely. We are indebted to them,for their service to our country, for their service to humanity.  ISHA: I'd like to share a couple of stories, to highlight what some of our colleagues have done in this time: One of our Jio engineers Mr Dave trekked 12 kms at 13,000 ft, in 10 ft of snow, through non-motorable roads, to restore digital connectivity in the Spiti Valley.  AKASH: When the cyclone hit Mumbai earlier this year, some of our Jio &amp;amp;amp; Retail stores faced indefinite power cuts. Our Store Manager Rupesh and so many others kept the stores running on minimum power consumption to ensure uninterrupted supplies to their customers.  ISHA: Many of our front line warriors contracted COVID themselves in the course of their duty but their selfless courage has inspired us every moment of this fight.  For over an year, Ricky Bindra, head of our Corporate Services, had been tirelessly organizing daily meals for the needy, setting up tie-ups for beds, medications, ventilators, oxygen, ambulances, and vaccinations for our entire Reliance Family.  Last month, Ricky and his family were diagnosed COVID positive. Ricky himself was in the ICU for 30 days, completely paralysed for 20 days, on a ventilator for 10 days, but by the grace of God, he is ok and on the road to rehab &amp;amp;amp; recovery now.  Our salute to Ricky, and countless other members of our Reliance family, who have placed their country first, community next, family third, and self last in this hour of need. They are our real-life super-heroes.  AKASH: Thanks to their spirited efforts, millions of our fellow Indians have continued to work from home, shop from home, learn from home, and consult doctors from the safety of their homes, in these tough times.  Our colleagues personify the DNA of Reliance - to CARE, UNITE, INTEGRATE, &amp;amp;amp; EMPOWER.  ISHA: Truly Akash! And to tell us more about Reliance Family's unified and tireless response to this crisis, Let us now welcome the Founder-Chairperson of the Reliance Foundation, our dearest mother, Mrs Nita Ambani!  Thank you, Isha &amp;amp;amp; Akash. Esteemed Shareholders, Namaskar.  I hope that all of you and your loved ones are well and safe. The COVID-19 pandemic is a humanitarian crisis. It has tested the very spirit of humanity. But even in the darkest hour, our spirit has shone bright. We as a people have come together, and fought this battle with immense empathy and compassion.  Reliance Foundation, over the last 11 years, has always stood shoulder to shoulder with the people of India, in every challenge big or small, through good &amp;amp;amp; bad times.  We have tried to make a difference to the lives of 45 million Indians across the country. In the remotest villages and towns of India, we have found and created stories of hope, of change, of transformation. And so last year, when humanity was struck with the worst crisis in over a 100 years,  we did our best to help in whichever way we could, and did so urgently. While our top priority this year was COVID relief, we ensured that we continued all our other developmental work as well.  We remained committed to our vision for Education and Sport for All. Within days of the outbreak, our 14 schools turned into digital schools. They became safe havens of positivity and learning for thousands of students who embraced virtual schooling with unimaginable enthusiasm!  We have also worked very hard through these challenging times, to bring our dream project &ndash; the Jio Institute &ndash; to life! Jio Institute is envisioned to be an exemplary academic institution with a world class platform for research, innovation, and lifelong learning. It will prepare the next generation of global leaders who will significantly contribute to the advancement of India and the world. Despite the pandemic, I am pleased to announce that Jio Institute is all set to commence academic sessions at their campus in Navi Mumbai this year itself!  This year we also launched Reliance Foundation Scholarships in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, for undergraduates and postgraduates.  Beyond education, sport has been another symbol of hope, a medium to delight and inspire the world in these times. In 2020, our champions Mumbai Indians brought in a lot of joy and cheer to millions, by winning their fifth IPL trophy! I wish our team all the best for the upcoming second leg of the IPL 2021.  Our football league ISL became the first, the longest, and the biggest sporting event to be held entirely in India with complete safety protocols, during the pandemic. It took more than 1600 people in 18 different bio-bubbles across 14 different locations in Goa, to pull off Season 7 of the Indian Super League very successfully.  Apart from cricket and football, we continue to focus on other sports like athletics, archery, basketball, badminton, and weightlifting. We have reached out to over 21.5 million children through our grassroots initiatives in various sports all across India. We hope to develop a holistic ecosystem that identifies and trains our young champions of tomorrow!  Speaking of champions, I would like to wish all our athletes of Team India the very best for the upcoming Tokyo Olympic Games!  On a personal note, in December last year, Mukesh and I became proud grand-parents to our dearest Akash &amp;amp;amp; Shloka's precious baby boy Prithvi Akash Ambani! Thank you all for your good wishes &amp;amp;amp; blessings on this happy occasion in our family.  Friends,  I am a big believer in the phenomenal power of women. I believe that when women lean on women, incredible things happen. It is my dream and mission to empower every girl in India to write her own destiny.  On Women's Day in March this year, we launched a digital movement for women called Her Circle. Her Circle is an inclusive, collaborative, interactive, and socially-conscious digital platform. A circle of solidarity, sisterhood, and growth.  Reliance Foundation also partnered with USAID to launch the Women Connect India Challenge this year. A partnership that aims to empower more and more Indian women with digital reach and opportunity. Digital technology truly is the backbone of this new world order.  Using the power of digital, we also helped rural communities safeguard their lives and livelihoods from the natural calamities that affected India this year, be it the floods in Assam and Uttarakhand, or the cyclones on our eastern and western coast.  Friends,  Now I would like to take you through the work that Reliance Foundation is doing in our nation's fight against the pandemic. Over the past 15 months, for Mukesh and me, the top priority has been to do whatever we can to help our nation and our people in these difficult times.  Reliance Foundation launched FIVE Missions to fight the virus:  1. Mission Oxygen  2. Mission COVID Infra  3. Mission Anna Seva  4. Mission Employee Care  5. and Mission Vaccine Suraksha Let me start with Mission Oxygen.  As you know, India faced an acute shortage of oxygen as soon as COVID cases began to surge earlier this year. Reliance swung into action on a war footing immediately.  Traditionally, we have never produced medical grade liquid oxygen. Yet when the need arose, we repurposed our Jamnagar refinery within days, to produce high-purity medical grade liquid oxygen and, within two weeks, we ramped up production to a massive 1100 Metric Tonnes per day.  It would normally take over a year to set up a new medical grade oxygen plant of this capacity. But it was a super-human effort by our Reliance engineers, who put in more than 85,000 man-hours of work in less than 10 days to make it possible. They delivered what mattered the most, when it mattered the most!  You will feel proud to know that today Reliance is producing over 11% of India's medical-grade liquid oxygen, the highest by a single company at a single location. We are providing this Pran Vayu &ndash; oxygen &ndash; to one out of every 10 COVID patients in India&hellip; and offering this service to the nation FREE OF COST.  For Mukesh and me, and every member of our Reliance Family, this opportunity to serve humanity is the noblest of all noble causes.  Friends,  In the oxygen supply chain, we have addressed India's serious bottleneck of tankers. Reliance procured 100 new medical-grade oxygen tankers both from within India and other parts of the world, like Germany, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Netherlands, Belgium, Thailand, Indonesia, and put them into service within two weeks.  We also helped in installing Oxygen Generators in several hospitals across the country, to strengthen oxygen availability. I salute all our engineers, doctors, and frontline warriors for working selflessly &amp;amp;amp; tirelessly for Mission Oxygen.  Dear Shareholders,  The key to fighting the pandemic is a strong COVID care infrastructure.  That is what we have tried to achieve through Mission COVID Infra. Last year, within days of the coronavirus outbreak, we set up India's first dedicated 250 bedded COVID facility in Mumbai.  By the time the second wave hit us, we had set up additional 875 beds for COVID care in Mumbai alone. Across India, we created a total capacity of over 2000 beds for COVID care, all equipped to provide uninterrupted oxygen supply and totally free-of-cost treatment.  We also launched a COVID testing lab with a capacity of over 15,000 tests per day.  The entire medical fraternity are the Real Heroes of this fight. They have put their own lives at risk, to save others', day after day. They have stayed isolated and away from their families and loved ones, to care for us.They have worked long hours at a stretch wearing full PPE kits, but never complained.  They have compromised their own health, and gone way beyond their call of duty. Dr. Tarang, Dr. Darshana, Dr Vivek, Sister Aneta, Sister Agnes, Sister Kusum, Brothers Chandrashekhar and Omkar, Managers Akanksha and Kumkum, Shivam, Vikas, Trinette, Mayank, Mayuri,  and countless others&hellip;  They became like friends and families for patients in COVID wards, caring for them, cheering for them, sometimes singing &amp;amp;amp; dancing for them! Their bravery, their selflessness, and their large-heartedness is a tribute to humanity in its purest form.  As a community, we owe each and every front-line warrior a huge debt. With folded hands, I salute their spirit of care and sacrifice. A big thank you on behalf of all of us.  A heartfelt dhanyawad.  Friends,  In the early days of the lockdown, we launched Mission Anna Seva, our commitment to feed the needy, and we extended it to include cattle and stray animals. Today, this commitment has taken the form of the largest meal distribution programme undertaken by a corporate foundation anywhere in the world. We have so far provided more than 7.5 crore free meals to marginalised communities, daily-wage earners, and frontline workers across the country.  Dear Shareholders,  Our next mission &ndash; Mission Employee Care &ndash; is an expression of our care and concern for the most precious members of our extended family, our Reliance Family.  Sanskar aur Mulyoon ke adhar par, humara yeh vishaal reliance parivaar&hellip; humien taaqat deta hai, hausla deta hai, prerna deta hai&hellip; Uski har khushi mein hum saath hain, Aur uske har dukh mein hum hissedar hain...  When the pandemic started last year, literally overnight we migrated to a full-time work-from-home mode. Across Reliance, we made sure that no jobs, no salaries, no bonuses were cut due to COVID. All medical expenses were paid fully, and fully paid leaves were granted. It breaks our hearts that in spite of our best efforts, we lost some precious members of our Reliance Family to the pandemic. Nothing can fill the void they have left in our minds and hearts.  The entire Reliance Family stands in solidarity with their families, and shares their grief. We remain committed to their families' continued well-being and fulfilling the dreams that they saw together. Towards this end, Reliance will continue to:  - pay the deceased employee's salary to the family for the next five years;  - finance their children's education in India till graduation,  - and, ensure continuity of medical coverage to the family for life.  Additionally, a lump-sum amount of TEN lakhs will be provided to families of our off-roll employees who succumbed to COVID-19.  My prayers, thoughts, and deepest condolences are with every family who has lost a loved one. Om Shanti.  Dear friends,  Our fifth and most critical mission is 'Mission Vaccine Suraksha'.  Mass Vaccination is India's topmost and urgent priority now. It is the most reliable way out of this crisis. And to achieve this in the shortest possible time, the Government of India has recently allowed private enterprises and hospitals to join the effort. To help speed up the vaccination drive, we have set up 116 vaccinations centres in 109 cities across the country.  We have made the entire vaccination process very easy &amp;amp;amp; accessible on our physical/digital platform JioHealthHub with a click of a button, you can book a slot or download CoWin Certificates.  Reliance Foundation will offer this platform absolutely free of cost to all users. The platform has the ability to scale up to 1 lakh vaccinations a day, that's one crore vaccinations in 100 days. We are continuously working to further increase this number.  We hope to partner with other corporate and local authorities towards fulfilling the mission of vaccinating all Indians by the end of this year. As we speak, we are already testing this platform with our Reliance family.  We are currently vaccinating all 20 lakh of our Extended Family, including retired employees, partner company employees, and their families &ndash; free of cost. Reliance's Mission Vaccine Suraksha is one of the largest corporate vaccination drives in India.  Executing this Mission on a nationwide basis is a humongous task. But it is our dharma, our duty to every Indian, our promise of safety and protection. Our firm belief that together, we can, and we will overcome.  My dear shareholders,  It is so inspiring to see each and every member of the Reliance Family come together to do their bit and make a difference. And this journey is made even more fulfilling &ndash;  When we get a thank you message from a mother who recovers from COVID, and then reunites with her child, when a senior citizen blesses us for providing essentials at her doorstep, when a migrant family feels they are not alone in the city, when a doctor or nurse on duty can protect themselves as they receive the PPE in time, when a hungry stray dog feels human compassion, when a daughter stuck far away can provide for her old parents through digital solutions and children can continue learning and seeing their friends in virtual school.  These are moments that make you believe that we are in this fight together. And I assure you that in every challenge that India faces, Reliance Foundation has and will continue to stand with every Indian. Together, we shall overcome&hellip;as we always have.  Please take care, stay safe, stay healthy, and stay hopeful. Jai Hind!  Thank you.  Chairman Continues:  Thank you, Nita. Thank you, Isha and Akash.  Let us give a standing ovation to each and every member of Team Reliance for their exemplary commitment, devotion and resolve, for going beyond the call of duty in serving the society in its hour of greatest need. I indeed feel immense pride in leading such a team that combines excellence with empathy.  My Dear Shareholders,  I now turn to the Business and Financial Performance of your company for the Year 2020-21.  2. Business &amp;amp;amp; Financial Performance  I am happy to report that even in a challenging environment, your company's performance continued to be outstanding.  Our consolidated revenue was nearly Rs. 540,000 crore, with a sharp increase from our consumer businesses. Our consolidated EBITDA was nearly Rs. 98,000 crore, and almost 50% of the EBITDA was contributed by consumer businesses.  One of these consumer businesses, Retail, is only about a decade old. The other business, Jio, is only five years old.  Our net profit for the year was Rs. 53,739 crore, higher by 34.8% compared to the previous year. Despite the pandemic, we increased our dividends this year.  Dear Friends,  As India's largest business enterprise, Reliance's contribution to the Indian economy continues to remain unmatched.  At Rs. 1,45,143 crore (US$ 19.9 billion), we continue to be India's largest exporter accounting for 6.8% of India's total merchandise exports across 107 countries.  Even in this challenging environment, Reliance added nearly 75,000 new jobs in the past year. We are committed to creating and enabling large-scale employment opportunities, which is one of India's most urgent national tasks.  We continue to be India's highest payer of customs and excise duty in the private sector with payments of Rs. 21,044 crore. We are amongst the highest payers of GST and VAT at Rs. 85,306 crore.We are amongst the highest payers of Income Tax in the private sector paying Rs. 3,213 crore.  In FY 2021, Reliance successfully carried out the largest ever capital raise by any company globally in a year, notwithstanding the COVID challenges.  The capital raises exceeded Rs. 324,432 crore (USD 44.4 billion) through equity in Jio Platforms and Retail, Rights Issue and asset monetization. The investors included some of the best and marquee names across the world; across sovereign wealth funds, and private equity.  This capital raise is a strong vote of confidence by global investors in India's growth potential. It reflects their faith in the ability of your company's management to execute ambitious projects and long-term value creation plans.  We also rewarded the shareholders with the largest and the most successful Rights Issue ever by an Indian company.I am really delighted that our retail shareholders have made 4x returns in just one year on their rights shares.  All of these helped Reliance achieve a net debt-free balance sheet much ahead of March 2021, a promise I had made two years ago.  Dear friends,  Let me now talk about the performance of the individual businesses.  Jio Platforms is the leading digital company in India with leadership in wireless connectivity and unmatched suite of apps and platforms.  The consolidated revenues in the past year were Rs. 86,493 crore, with EBITDA of Rs. 32,359 crore. We had a net addition of 37.9 million subscribers during the year. We now serve over 425 million consumers on our network. We have revenue market leadership in 19 out of 22 circles.  Reliance Retail continues to be the undisputed leader in organised retailing in the country, with scale that is more than 6 times the next competitor.  Despite a challenging year, Retail had revenues of Rs. 153,818 crore, and EBITDA of Rs. 9,842 crore. We are by far the leader in each category &mdash; grocery, electronics and apparel.  Our O2C business faced unprecedented challenges as the beginning of the year was marked by severe economic contraction, leading to demand destruction and supply chain dislocations. We focussed on safe operations of all our facilities. We were probably the only company globally that operated its facilities at near full capacity and was profitable in every quarter.  Our consolidated revenues during the year were Rs. 320,008 crore, with EBITDA of Rs. 38,170 crore. We managed to maintain EBITDA margin at 11.9% despite volatility in both feedstock and product prices.  We operationalised the JV with bp in fuel retailing, using technology and innovation to deliver new customer value.  The demand and margin environment for petrochemicals had recovered to pre-COVID levels by March. I am confident that our O2C business will benefit from the strong global growth environment.  As an important part of this vision of achieving accelerated growth, we look forward to welcoming Saudi Aramco as a strategic partner in our O2C business.  Despite several challenges due to COVID-19, we have made substantial progress in the past year in our discussions. These discussions have been held in the spirit of mutual commitment to convert our long-standing relationship into a perpetual partnership.  This continued engagement and resolve from both sides, even during this pandemic, is a testimony of strong relationship between Saudi Aramco and Reliance. I expect our partnership to be formalised in an expeditious manner during this year, after obtaining required regulatory clearances.  In our E&amp;amp;amp;P business, bp and Reliance commenced production in KGD6 basin. Our JV brought two of our three toughest deep water gas projects to production. This has been accomplished in record time and set a new global benchmark for capital costs.  We are now on course to bring the third Deepwater MJ field onstream in the last quarter of 2022. Together we will produce 30 MMSCMD gas production by 2023. This will establish Reliance again as one of the largest producers of gas in India, meeting 20% of India's gas demand. E&amp;amp;amp;P will again be a source of significant value and sustained earnings growth over the next decade.  Dear Shareholders,  Today I am happy to inform you about a change in the Board of Reliance Industries Limited. Shri YP Trivedi has expressed his desire to retire from the Board. It is my duty to place on record our sincerest thanks to Trivediji. He joined our Board at the request of our Founder Dhirubhai Ambani in 1992.  On behalf of the entire Board and the shareholders, I would like to thank him from the bottom of all our hearts for his wise counsel and sage advice for nearly 30 years.  Respected Trivediji, we wish you continued good health and happiness. You are now 92 years young. May God bless you to become a Shatayushi &ndash; a centurion.  I am delighted to welcome H.E. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, Chairman of Saudi Aramco and the Governor of the Public Investment Fund, to join the Board of Reliance Industries Limited as an Independent Director. He is one of the most renowned names in energy and finance globally.  I am sure that we will immensely benefit from his rich experience with one of the world's largest companies, and also one of the largest Sovereign Wealth Funds in the world.  His joining our Board is also the beginning of internationalisation of Reliance. You will hear more about our international plans in the times to come.  3. New Energy Business: Vision, Mission and Implementation Plan  Dear Shareholders,  Last year I had shared with you our vision to create the next big Value Creation Engine for Reliance and India &ndash; our New Energy and New Materials business.  I had also announced our 15-year commitment to become net carbon zero by 2035. Today I am happy to present to you our ambitious strategy and roadmap for implementing this vision.  The world is entering a new energy era, which is going to be highly disruptive. The age of fossil fuels, which powered economic growth globally for nearly three centuries, cannot continue much longer. The huge quantities of carbon it has emitted into the environment have endangered life on Earth.  Our world has only one option: rapid transition to a new era of green, clean and renewable energy. The COVID pandemic has further put the climate issue in the crisis bucket.  Therefore, the global new energy agenda needs to move from dialogue to action, from commitment to urgent implementation on the ground. In reality, it is not enough to be carbon neutral; the world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions as soon as possible.  Last month, the International Energy Agency (IEA) for the first time presented a concrete global roadmap for the energy sector to remove all emissions by 2050. The roadmap calls for annual additions of solar Photovoltaic to increase global solar capacity from 737 GW in 2020 to about 5,000 GW by the end of 2030.  While this clean energy transition is a global imperative, it is important for India and other developing nations for another reason. India is experiencing an Explosion of Aspirations  India's GDP per capita is around 2,000 dollars while the world average is around 12,000 dollars. India's power consumption per capita at present is only one third of global consumption.  This Wealth Disparity and Energy Disparity is unacceptable. Furthermore, the health, wellbeing and quality of life of every human being is in peril because of the polluted environment.  The only answer to these problems lies in Sustainable and Equitable Development in India and globally. How do we increase our energy production while drastically reducing our carbon emission content?  How do we meet India's growing energy needs through domestic sources of energy, and not by importing carbon intensive fuels?  How do we do so in a self-reliant and affordable way which benefits 1.35 billion Indians?  These are the challenges that we face. I firmly believe that India can, India must, and India will meet these challenges.  Friends,  Today I would like to make three affirmations.  First: As one of the biggest energy markets in the world, India will play a leading role in transforming the global energy landscape.  Second: As a company always focused on growing businesses of the future, Reliance will provide leadership on the combined strength of our balance-sheet, talent, technology and proven project execution capabilities.  Third: Reliance will make its New Energy business a truly global business. In 2016, we launched Jio with the aim of bridging the Digital Divide in India.  Now, in 2021, we are launching our new energy business with the aim of bridging the green energy divide in India and globally. And we will do it &mdash; like we have always done &mdash; by getting our First Principles right.  First through Hyper-Integration: By integrating scientific knowledge with continuous technological innovation to build and operate truly integrated systems that deliver hyper-performance;  Second with a Robust business model: By building a model that catches the irreversible upward curve in the demand for green, clean and renewable energy in India and globally; and the downward curve in the cost of their production;  Third by Scale: By improving the efficiency, performance and life-cycle of our assets and operations to achieve total system optimisation and economics.  Friends,  I have no doubt that world-class talent will be the most critical resource for this new business. We have begun the process of attracting the best talent from across the world and put into place various key initiatives.  We have established the Reliance New Energy Council with some of the finest minds, globally. They will help us validate our strategies and embrace disruptive pathways to achieve our goals.  We are creating a coalition of partnerships with leading global universities, best technology companies and most promising start-ups in America, Europe, Australia and Asia. In addition, we shall leverage our existing strengths and capabilities in digitisation platforms and large-scale manufacturing.  Dear Shareholders,  I am happy to inform you that we have started work on developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex on 5,000 acres in Jamnagar.  It will be amongst the largest such integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world. Jamnagar was the CRADLE OF OUR OLD ENERGY BUSINESS. Jamnagar will also be the CRADLE OF OUR NEW ENERGY BUSINESS. Allow me to take you through our 3-part plan.  The first part of our plan is to build Four Giga Factories.  These will manufacture and fully integrate all the critical components of the New Energy ecosystem. One, for the production of solar energy &mdash; we will build an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory.  Two, for the storage of intermittent energy &mdash; we will build an advanced energy storage battery factory. Three, for the production of green hydrogen &mdash; we will build an electrolyser factory.  Four, for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power &ndash; we will build a fuel cell factory.  Over the next 3 years we will invest over 60,000 crore rupees in these initiatives. Reliance will thus create and offer a fully integrated, end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem.  Friends,  Allow me to explain each of these facilities in some more detail.  Our first Integrated Solar Photovoltaic Giga Factory will create solar energy. We will start with raw silica and convert this to poly silicon which we will then convert to ingot and wafers. These wafers would be used to make high efficiency solar cells and finally assembled into solar modules of highest quality and durability.  We will target to achieve costs that are lowest in the world to ensure affordability of our solar modules. We are highly inspired by the goal set by our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji for India to achieve 450GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.  Out of this, I am pleased to announce today, that Reliance will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy by 2030. A significant part of this will come from rooftop solar and decentralised solar installations in villages. These will bring enormous benefits and prosperity to rural India.  Solar energy is available only during the day, while power is needed round the clock. Therefore, storage is an important piece of the puzzle to solve. For this, we will launch our second initiative &mdash; an Advanced Energy Storage Giga Factory.  We are exploring new and advanced electro chemical technologies that can be used for such large-scale grid batteries to store the energy that we will create. We will collaborate with global leaders in battery technology to achieve the highest reliability for round-the-clock power availability through a combination of generation, storage, and grid connectivity.  Besides Electricity, Green Hydrogen will be a unique energy vector that can enable deep decarbonization of many sectors such as transportation, industry and power. One of the most common methods of generating Green Hydrogen is by electrolysis of pure water through Electrolysers.  This brings me to our third initiative &mdash; an Electrolyser Giga Factory to manufacture modular electrolysers of highest efficiency and lowest capital cost. These can be used for captive production of green hydrogen for domestic use as well as for global sale.  And, finally, our fourth initiative will be the Fuel Cell Giga Factory. A Fuel Cell uses Oxygen from the air and Hydrogen, to generate electricity. The only emission of this process is non-polluting water vapour.  In the new era, Fuel Cells will progressively replace internal combustion engines. Fuel Cell engines can power automobiles, trucks and buses.They can also be used in stationary applications for powering data centres, telecom towers, emergency generators and micro grids and industrial equipment.  This brings me to the second part of our plan &ndash; providing infrastructure and materials to support the four Giga factories.  Our Jamnagar complex will provide infrastructure and utilities to manufacture ancillary material and equipment needed to support these Giga factories so that all critical materials are available in time. We will also support independent manufacturers with right capabilities to be part of this nationwide ecosystem.  We will invest an additional Rs. 15,000 crore in value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries. Thus, our overall initial investment from our own internal resources in the New Energy business will be Rs. 75,000 (over $10 billion) crore in 3 years.  Now let me take you through the third part of our plan:  Over the years, Reliance has developed significant engineering, project management and construction capabilities combining physical and digital technologies.  We will repurpose these capabilities, along with major international organisations to execute and deliver world class, renewable energy solutions.  We will build two additional divisions to further strengthen this ecosystem. First, a dedicated Renewable Energy Project Management and Construction Division. Second, a dedicated Renewable Energy Project Finance Division.  The Renewable Energy Project Management and Construction Division will provide gigawatt scale end-to-end solutions for large renewable plants across the world. It will enable and partner with thousands of Green MSME Entrepreneurs, who can deploy kilowatt to megawatt scale solutions in agriculture, industry, residences and transportation.  The Renewable Energy Project Finance Division will provide finance solutions to the stakeholders in our ecosystem. We will achieve our goals by enabling a platform to source long-term global capital for these investments at the most attractive terms.  We will seek support from our relationship banks and global green funds for this purpose. Simultaneously, we will also facilitate a platform to provide financing for the entire ecosystem of small businesses and entrepreneurs who invest alongside with us.  All of these three parts together constitute our architecture for India's decentralised Green Economy. Over a period of time, it will generate millions of new and high-value job opportunities for our youth. With these new initiatives, Reliance will put Gujarat and India on world solar and hydrogen map.  All our products will proudly proclaim: Made in India, by India, for India and for the world! This will be Reliance's yet another big contribution to our Prime Minister's clarion call of Atmanirbhar Bharat.  I am certain that India will present to the world a template of a Green Economy Movement, which will truly be a  People's Movement.  Solar power is the primary source of energy for our Planet Earth. 'Soorya Dev' has blessed India with almost limitless sunlight.  I envision a future when our country will be transformed from a large Importer of Fossil Energy to a large Exporter of Clean Solar Energy solutions.  Dear Friends,  Reliance is also evolving a vision for NEW MATERIALS and GREEN CHEMICALS. We will kickstart this by strategically investing in India's first world-scale CARBON FIBER plant for supporting our hydrogen and solar ecosystems. You will hear more about this in the months to come.  Our new Green Vision also has immense benefits for our existing O2C business. Allow me to take you through these:  First, we will use solar energy on an economically attractive basis to decarbonise our existing O2C business and accelerate our journey to become net carbon zero.  Second, we will use Green Hydrogen and CO2 as raw materials to develop a road map for new Green Chemicals, Green Fertilizer and e-fuels.  Third, we will commercialise with global partners our own world-beating proprietary Multi-zone Catalytic Cracking (MCC) Technology to optimise the fossil fuel transition to sustainable chemical and material building blocks.  Thus, we will transform our legacy business into sustainable, circular and net zero carbon materials business. One that will provide growing returns over several decades. And we will do this by repurposing our existing assets to extend their economic life and earning capacity. In doing so we will have no legacy asset write-downs in the coming years.  Dear Shareholders,  This twin execution plan of building a New Energy and materials ecosystem and decarbonising and repurposing our existing O2C business is a multi-decade growth path for our company. It has the potential to create unprecedented value for India and for Reliance in the coming years.  Dear Shareholders,  New Energy and New Materials are not merely another business for us.It is our mission to heal the environment. It is an expression of Reliance's commitment that WE CARE for our beautiful and bountiful planet.  By implementing our Green Vision, Reliance will help transition India and the World from an Industrial Civilisation to an Ecological Civilisation. We are repaying our debt of gratitude to Mother Nature.  Dear Shareholders,  Let me tell you, in all humility, that New Energy is the most exciting, most challenging and most purpose-driven mission I will be pursuing in my life. I seek your blessings and support for success in this mission.  4. Reliance Jio  Dear Friends,  Let me now turn to JIO, our digital services initiative.  In spite of COVID, JIO sustained its track record of robust performance. JIO became the first operator outside China to cross 400 million mobile subscribers in a single country.  We are truly grateful to all our valued customers. Thanks to them, JIO is today the world's second largest mobile data carrier handling monthly traffic of over 630 crore GIGABYTES.  This is nearly 45% growth in data consumption in the last year alone, a testament to the rapid pace at which India is digitizing.  More significantly, JIO continued to be the digital lifeline binding Indians together despite social distancing, lockdowns and working-from-home. During the past year, we also made the necessary capital investments to further strengthen our market position and growth.  During recent spectrum auctions, we invested Rs. 57,123 crore to acquire significant additional spectrum, making JIO the largest operator of 4G spectrum in India. And we have operationalized nearly 100% of this additional spectrum.  When combined with another Rs. 15,183 crore we invested in further expanding our network infrastructure, JIO has raised the bar even higher for service quality and JIO's leadership is evident across India along all key metrics like indoor coverage, download speeds and video experience.  More importantly these investments have also created the capacity to on-board an additional 200 million customers on JIO's network thereby bringing digital empowerment to even more Indians.  Friends,  JIO has truly democratized digital connectivity in India by offering the highest quality, most affordable 4G broadband  services in the world. Even so, India still has nearly 300 million mobile users who are unable to escape from inefficient and exorbitant 2G services because even a basic 4G smartphone remains unaffordable for these users.  Therefore, an ultra-affordable 4G smartphone is essential to make India &ldquo;2G-mukt&rdquo;. Last year, Sundar and I had talked about Google and JIO co-developing a next-generation, feature-rich, but extremely affordable smartphone, aimed at providing first-time internet access for 2G users.  Today, I am pleased to announce that Google and JIO teams have jointly developed a truly breakthrough Smartphone, that we are calling JIOPHONE Next.  JIOPHONE Next is a fully featured smartphone, supporting the entire suite of applications from both Google and Jio, as well as the Android Play Store through which users will have access to the entire universe of Android Apps.  JIOPHONE Next is powered by an extremely optimised version of the Android Operating System, that has been jointly developed by JIO and Google, especially for the Indian market.  While being ultra-affordable, JIOPHONE Next is packed with cutting-edge features like the voice assistant, automatic read-aloud of screen text, language translation, smart camera with augmented reality filters and much more.  This is a testimony to a global technology giant and a national technology champion working jointly to make a break- through product, that can be first introduced in India and then taken to the rest of the world.  JIOPHONE Next will be available in the market from the auspicious date of Ganesh Chaturthi, 10th September this year,  And as you have come to expect from Jio, it is my promise that JIOPHONE Next will be by far, amongst the most affordable smartphone not just in India, but globally.  Let me now invite my good friend Sundar to talk about JioPhone Next, and other areas of collaboration between Google and JIO.  Sundar Pichai Speech:  &ldquo;Thank you to Mukesh, Nita, Akash, and Isha - and to everyone at Reliance Industries for all you do for India&hellip;  From investing in infrastructure and technology... to creating jobs and expanding opportunity&hellip; to supporting communities in need, especially in this difficult moment for the country.  It's been devastating to see the country hit so hard by COVID-19. Yet it's heartening to see how Reliance has stepped up to contribute to the national response and get support to the communities that need it most.  On behalf of all of us at Google: we hope you are taking care...and are wishing for better days ahead.  For Google, the past year has brought renewed purpose and greater urgency to our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.  At a time when so many aspects of our lives and work are moving online, it's even more important to make technology accessible and helpful for everyone.  This goal is at the heart of our partnership with Reliance Jio. I was proud to help launch this partnership last year.  It was the first and biggest equity investment from the Rs. 75,000 crore Google for India Digitization Fund.  Our vision was to bring affordable access to information for Indians in their own language... to build new products and services for India's unique needs... and empower businesses with technology.  I'm excited that today, we can announce the next steps in this vision: Starting with a new, affordable, Jio smartphone, created with Google.  Our teams have optimised a version of our Android OS especially for this device. It will offer language and translation features, a great camera, and support for the latest Android updates.  It is built for India&hellip; And it will open up new possibilities for millions of new users who will experience the internet for the very first time&hellip;. And we can't wait to show you the device later this year.  I'm also proud to announce that we are taking our collaboration further&hellip; with a new 5G partnership between Google Cloud and Jio.  It will help more than a billion Indians connect to a faster and better internet... support businesses in their digital transformation&hellip; and help Jio build new services in sectors like health, education and more &mdash; laying a foundation for the next phase of India's digitization.  As part of this collaboration, Reliance will also shift its core retail businesses to Google Cloud's infrastructure.  They will be able take advantage of Google's AI and machine learning, ecommerce, and demand forecasting offerings.  Harnessing the reliability and performance of Google Cloud will enable these businesses to scale up as needed to respond to customer demand.  Empowering businesses as they embark on their digital transformation is a key part of our mission in India, and I'm excited for the innovations this partnership will help unleash.  We are proud to play a part in India's next wave of technological innovation.  Helping to connect 1.3 billion Indians to the opportunities the internet creates is meaningful to all of us at Google -- and certainly to me personally.  I know that with greater access to smartphones and improved connectivity, there's no limit to what India's people can do.  We look forward to getting technology into the hands of more people...and to exploring what more we can achieve together in the years ahead.  Thank you.&rdquo; Thank you, Sundar. We greatly value our partnership with Google. Friends,  As Sundar mentioned, Cloud and Cloud solutions, is another area where we are collaborating with Google. JIO will use Google Cloud's cutting-edge technologies to power JIO's 5G Solutions and for powering the internal needs of key Reliance growth businesses like Reliance Retail, JioMart, JioSaavn and JioHealth.  Friends,  We have also made significant progress in the collaborations that we announced last year.  Let me start with FACEBOOK - We have launched an initial set of integrations between WhatsApp and JioMart on a trial basis and the response from WhatsApp and JioMart customers is encouraging along with lots of valuable feedback. Our joint teams are actively developing the full New Commerce solution linking merchants and consumers, and we plan to progressively launch these over the next few quarters.  With MICROSOFT - We have operationalized an initial 10 MW capacity of JIO-AZURE Cloud Data centres in two cities, Jamnagar and Nagpur. We are currently onboarding the initial group of pilot customers and we plan to expand our data centre capacity and our offerings to a growing number of SMEs and start-ups over the coming quarters.  We are indeed privileged to have partners like Facebook, Google and Microsoft, in whose company, our efforts to create a DIGITAL SOCIETY in India seems that much easier.  Friends,  Across the world, the past 15 months have been challenging for on-the-ground physical work.  JIOFIBER, JIO's optical fiber-based, gigabit speed, fixed broadband services has also faced similar challenges. The pace of Optical fiber deployment, building-connectivity and home-installations have all been slower than expected because of lockdowns and other restrictions across our country.  Despite this, I am glad to announce that JIOFIBER has acquired more than 2 million new premises over the past year, following all safety protocols for our customers and employees. Now, with a cumulative base of 3 million active home and business users, JIOFIBER has become the largest and the fastest growing fixed broadband operator in India.  Data consumption on JIOFIBER has grown to more than 3.5 times compared to a year ago. Today, JIO's optical-fiber network is physically present outside more than 12 million homes and business premises, with a deep fiber footprint in the top 100 cities.  I continue to be confident of a rapid uptake of JIOFIBER services and revenue growth for JIO as India recovers from COVID.  Dear Shareholders,  I announced last year that JIO's engineers have developed a 100% home-grown and comprehensive 5G solution which is fully cloud native, software defined, and digitally managed.  Jio has taken tremendous strides in maturing this state-of-the-art Standalone 5G technology, which signifies a quantum leap to the next frontier of wireless broadband. Together with our partners, we have tested the JIO 5G solutions in India and we successfully demonstrated speeds well in excess of 1 GBPS. Our 'Made in India' solution is comprehensive, complete and globally competitive. It reaffirms my faith in the abundant talent of Indian engineers to deliver world class products in such a cutting-edge technology.  Recently, we received the necessary regulatory approvals... as well as trial spectrum for initiating 5G field-trials. As I speak to you, the entire 5G Standalone Network has been installed in our data centres across the nation and also at our trial sites in Navi Mumbai.  We are confident of being the first to launch full-fledged 5G services. And because of our converged, future-proof architecture JIO's network is uniquely positioned to quickly and seamlessly upgrade from 4G to 5G.  To develop the end-to-end 5G ecosystem we are now working with leading global partners to develop a full range of 5G-capable devices. The Jio 5G technology is well positioned to create compelling applications for consumers and enterprises spanning Healthcare, Education, Entertainment, Retail and other key verticals of the economy.  One exciting 5G-enabled solution that JIO is developing with Sir H. N. Reliance Foundation Hospital is a state-of-the- art Connected Ambulance. With real-time, high-fidelity Telemedicine and remote doctor access, each Connected Ambulance can become a virtual extension of a hospital emergency room even while on the move.  We are developing with Reliance Foundation schools to use 5G to deliver immersive and interactive AR/ VR content to students and classrooms making the learning process a delightful, memorable and enriching experience.  We hope that such showcases will catalyse the emergence of a vibrant, local 5G ecosystem making India a global hub for 5G development and export. So JIO is not just working to make India 2G-MUKT&hellip; but also 5G-YUKT.  And, once JIO's 5G solution is proven at India-scale, we are excited by the prospect of exporting JIO 5G solutions to other telecom operators across the world.  Friends,  JIO has developed deep expertise in multiple emerging technologies like 5G, AI/ML and blockchain and Mixed Reality. We are developing 100% owned Intellectual Property&hellip;  We have access to deep domain knowledge and operational experience within the Reliance Group across key Industry verticals.  We have a passionate and talented team&hellip; and world-class partners and we have the opportunity to serve a global audience.  In all, JIO PLATFORMS is blossoming into a global technology player&hellip; capable of creating multifold societal, customer and shareholder value for years to come.  5. Reliance Retail  Dear Shareholders,  Now let me talk about Reliance Retail.  This past year was the true test for our business. Despite challenging and restrictive operating conditions, Reliance Retail continued to deliver industry leading returns.  We added 1,500 new stores, which is amongst the largest retail expansion undertaken by any retailer during this period, taking our store count to 12,711.  We continue to maintain and strengthen our leadership position. Today one in every eight Indians shops with Reliance Retail.  My Dear Shareholders,  Let me present some of the highlights for this year:  Our apparel business sold nearly five lakh units per day and over 18 crore units during the year. This is equivalent to dressing the entire population of UK, Germany and Spain once.  Ajio has emerged as one of the leading digital commerce platforms for fashion and lifestyle with a portfolio of over 2,000 labels and brands and listing of over 5 lakh options. Driven by innovation, Ajio now contributes to over 25% of our apparel business.  We further consolidated our position in consumer electronics and sold 4.5 crore units of electronics last year which translates to over 120,000 units per day.  Our Omni commerce capabilities allow us to deliver an unparalleled service proposition across 1,300 cities.  As India's largest grocery retailer, Reliance Retail sold over a billion units of groceries or about 30 lakh units per day. Our grocery staff operated on the frontlines of crisis ensuring availability of essential products to our customers and kirana partners.  JioMart registered over 6.5 lakh peak orders in a single day. JioMart's growth is a testament to its already loyal customer base, 80% of whom are repeat shoppers. JioMart New commerce's aim is to transform and grow the small merchant ecosystem, so our merchant partners prosper.  Over the past year, over 3 lakh merchant or shop keeper partners across 150 cities were enabled and empowered to transform their businesses both physically and digitally.  Our promise to them is simple:  'Customer Apka, Support Hamara' &mdash; We support you, so that you can serve your customers better&rsquo;  A testament to our promise is that we have seen a 3x growth in kirana orders and 2x growth in order frequency. Expansion across cities is well underway and we will onboard over One Crore merchant partners over the next three years.  This will trigger a socio-economic transformation on an extraordinary scale in India, especially when coupled with our mission of employment generation.  Even in these challenging times, I am personally proud to report to you that Reliance Retail has not only protected jobs, but also created over 65,000 new jobs. Reliance Retail currently employs over 2 lakh people making us one of the largest employers in the country. Over the next three years, we shall further create employment for over ten lakh people and enable the livelihoods for many more.  Growth in the retail sector will usher growth across the value chain &mdash; from raw material producers to large and small manufacturers, from logistics service providers to merchants, to Consumers. In order to expand this circle of shared prosperity, we will be focussing on the following five key initiatives:  First, we will further invest in our research, design and product development capabilities. In the next year we will set up design, research, technology and innovation centres in key areas globally and nationally to develop differentiated offerings for our diverse customer groups.  Second, we will further strengthen our sourcing ecosystem working closely with producers, MSMEs, service providers, local and international brand companies. We will make them our partners in the journey of value creation that our New Commerce model seeks to unlock.  Third, we are investing in building state-of-the-art supply chain infrastructure across India by linking all major sourcing and consumption locations. This will maximise efficiencies and minimise losses in the supply chain, so that we can share the gains with both consumers and producers.  An automated, modular, reliable and scalable warehousing and logistics ecosystem will enable us to deliver products anywhere across the country in the shortest possible time.  Fourth, we will focus on expanding our store footprint multi-fold this year with co-located delivery hubs over the next few years. They will provide a strong network to reach and serve millions of merchants and customers.  And fifth, we will continue acquiring businesses to heighten our offering and experience to customers, sharpen our omni-channel capabilities, drive operating efficiencies and strengthen our talent pool. Recent acquisitions include leading physical/digital commerce platforms like Netmeds, Urban Ladder and Zivame.  Reliance Retail continues to be amongst the fastest growing retailers in the world. We are committed to grow our business so that we are among the top 10 retailers globally. I am confident that Reliance Retail is on a hyper growth trajectory to grow at least 3x in the next 3-5 years.  6. Media Business  Dear Shareowners,  Network18 successfully overcame the logistical and business challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the pandemic, our journalists continue to venture out into the field every day so that viewers and readers get relevant information from inside the safety of their homes.  Our entertainment flagship brand, Colors, was the first to resume fresh programming after the first wave of lockdowns, being true to its mission of keeping India entertained with wholesome and creative fare.  7. Value Creation  I now will like to present our Value Creation roadmap.  Your company has a proven track record of creating maximum societal value and maximum shareholder value through our business operations as well as philanthropic initiatives. The year has proved, beyond doubt, the resilience of our businesses and our ability to continuously innovate to create value even in adverse conditions.  You are well aware of Reliance's epic journey &mdash; from being a small textile company that had its IPO less than 50 years ago to joining the ranks of 50 most valuable companies in the world.  Reliance is probably the only large company in the world that has successfully transformed itself from being a traditional industrial business into an enterprise that now includes two mega-scale consumer and technology businesses.  Both Jio and Retail are at the beginning of their journey. Yet, both have an embedded culture of continuous value creation. Both have also brought immense benefits to hundreds of millions of consumers by mastering the power of revolutionary new technologies.  Our O2C business combined with our new energy and materials plan will usher in a new era of exponential growth.  In the last 10 years, Reliance invested over USD 90 billion in creating substantial wealth for the nation and value for the shareholders. In the coming decade, Reliance has the capacity to catalyse investments of over USD 200 billion directly and through partners.  These investments will create value on an exponential scale. They will based on our disciplined capital allocation approach, preference for pursuing asset light strategies and emphasis on superior investment grade ratings.  These investments will also create over 10 lakh new employment opportunities, besides fostering thousands of small and medium enterprises across the country.  I assure you that your Company will consistently increase payout to its shareholders as our earnings continue to grow. I am confident that Reliance's multiple investment and business announcements today will help in kick-starting growth in the Indian economy.  I believe speedy recovery in the post-COVID period is beyond any doubt. But beyond recovery, there will be rapid resurgence. I have no doubt that India is destined to emerge as one of the top three economies in the world.  And as your company in its Golden Decade transforms itself as New Reliance, it is destined to play a proud role in the emergence of a New India.  My Most Esteemed Shareholders,  My father Dhirubhai founded Reliance on the principles of investing in future technologies, investing in Indian talent, and investing in India's growth opportunity.  I have continued the tradition of following his evergreen principles while growing Reliance as a world-class enterprise.  As Reliance climbs new summits of success in its onward journey, it will also cross new milestones in being a CARING and EMPATHETIC CORPORATE CITIZEN.  But believe me: The Best of Reliance is yet to come!  I have no doubt whatsoever that the next generation of leaders at Reliance, led by Isha, Akash and Anant, will further enrich this precious legacy.  8. Concluding Remarks  Dear Shareholders,  We are meeting at a time when the second wave of the Covid pandemic is fast receding.  Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Central Government and all the State Governments, along with civil society organisations and corporates, have co-ordinated a massive effort in this fight.  But as a company, as a country, as mankind &mdash; and each one of us as individuals &mdash; we have learnt an important lesson. We must be far better prepared to face such crises in future and never let our guard down.  To achieve this, the most essential resource we need &mdash; which is also the most useful resource &mdash; is a POSITIVE MINDSET.  In trying times like these, POSITIVITY acts like a highly effective medicine. It works wonders for individuals, families and for the society.  Despair weakens us. Determination strengthens us. Negativity numbs us with pessimism and inaction. Positivity provides us with hope and confidence. Our ancient civilisation has survived many crises in its long history.  Because our forefathers had UNLIMITED POSITIVITY and SELF-BELIEF.  My father, Dhirubhai Ambani, used to say, &ldquo;Challenge negative forces with hope, self-confidence and conviction, and the ambition and initiative will ultimately triumph.&rdquo; I have absolutely no doubt that India will conquer the COVID crisis &mdash; sooner rather than later.  Post COVID, India will emerge stronger. It will be a Better India, a Resurgent India, a more Equal India, and a far more Self-Confident India.  I foresee that the Indian economy will bounce back at a rate that will surprise the world. And prosperity and opportunities will be created for all on a scale never seen before. Not for a few, but for all 1.35 billion Indians.  Indeed, I see the global economy resetting itself in ways that will create a more EQUAL WORLD. May God forever guide us along this path.  9. Acknowledgements  I would like to thank the Central and State Governments, shareholders, investors, lenders, suppliers and customers for their consistent and resolute support.  I thank all my colleagues on the Board for their oversight in this crucial phase of our growth, their support and immense encouragement.  I have special words to acknowledge the collective efforts of the entire Reliance team, working tirelessly to create and sustain a world-class enterprise.  Thank you!  &amp;amp;nbsp;  June 24, 2021  Text of the speech ends here.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

What are your&nbsp;expectations from the event?  In the past 12 months, RIL has not only mobilised funds aggregating Rs 2,16,400 crore to de-leverage its balance sheet but also inducted strategic investors in its high growth businesses such as organised retail (Reliance Retail) and technology (Jio). In this context, RIL is expected to share the value added by each of these stakeholders to the individual businesses, how the individual businesses are shaping up, and what should be the growth/investment outlook.  Some comments are expected towards value unlocking in its O2C business, where outlook on margins is improving, given the pick up in global consumption. Media articles also suggest that RIL may induct Aramco's CEO on its board which would be seen as a step towards a much larger partnership between the two conglomerates.  Also read -&nbsp;RIL AGM on June 24 | Goldman Sachs expects the retail business to be the next growth engine  Investors are also expecting some comments on 1) progress and possible launch dates for the smartphone being developed by Jio and Google jointly; 2) roadmap for the listing of Reliance Retail and 3) progress to induct a strategic investor in O2C business.  RIL Chairman in the last AGM outlined ambitions to become a net carbon zero company by 2035. Investors would keenly await the strategy adopted by RIL to achieve this target, as it would significantly improve its positioning on the ESG (Environmental Social &amp;amp;amp; Governance) framework.  Q: What is the reason behind your bullish view on Reliance Industries; any price targets?&nbsp;  RIL's consolidated earnings are set to register a 17 percent per annum growth through FY21-23ii &ndash; on the back of - 1) recovery in the O2C business: cyclical recovery in gross refining margin (GRMs) aided by pick up in consumption across the globe clubbed with strength in petchem deltas; 2) 34 percent growth in Jio's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) (10 percent per annum growth in ARPU assumed); 3) 26 percent per annum growth in EBITDA of Reliance Retail, as we build in 14 percent per annum growth in the area under operations and improving revenue and profit margins. The earnings growth has an upside, provided the GRM (gross refining margin) improvement is ahead of estimate and recovery in retail sales growth is sharper. For a $1 per barrel change in GRMs, the earnings swing by 6 percent, while a 10 percent change in sales growth for Retail causes a consolidated PAT change of 2 percent.  In the base case, we value RIL at Rs 2,200 per share, near the CMP (current market price), but the stock can offer significant upsides with the following events: 1) value unlocking in the O2C segment (induction of strategic investor); 2) successful consummation of Future Retail's business which as of now is under litigation.

How much do you see it contributing by 2025?  The business outlook on Jio's operations is improving. The recently launched Jio Phone with attractive plans, the upcoming launch of the Google phone, and the capacity boost from a 45 percent increase in spectrum holdings post-March auctions are likely to result in higher subscriber adds in the next few months (notwithstanding some weakness in April and May due to the second wave of Covid).  With Vodafone Idea facing large cash outflows from December 2021, we see either industry-wide price hikes or accelerated market share loss for Vodafone Idea. Jio stands to benefit in either case. The progress on the FTTH (Fiber to the home) business remains steady. The key trigger to watch out for in the near term would be the pricing of the smartphone to be launched in collaboration with Google and the plans. IIFL expects Jio to contribute 13 percent to RIL&rsquo;s consolidated revenues by FY23.  Q: Do you think Reliance Industries will raise more funds for its retail and Jio businesses in the coming years?  RIL, through FY21, raised Rs 1.52 lakh crore and Rs 37,700 crore through induction of strategic investors in Jio and retail, respectively. The management commentary on capex intensity in each of these businesses is lowering at a time when the visibility on cash flows is set to improve. As such, the balance sheet of RIL and individual businesses is strong enough to pursue organic growth initiatives and bolster their competitive positioning in their respective addressable markets. We, however, expect RIL to induct a strategic investor in the O2C business sometime in the next 12-18 months and unlock value.  Q: Do you think Reliance will complete its stake sale in O2C business by 2022?  RIL has one of the most complex and integrated O2C business operations. Its deep integration helps to offset the impact of volatility in the feedstock prices and the product cracks on its O2C profits. While it is pursuing partnerships with global firms which can add value to its operations and enhance shareholders value, it would be inappropriate to comment on the timelines. This is because of two key reasons: first, the strategic partnerships are usually not forged by keeping specific timelines in mind, and secondly, it is a function of growth strategy outlined, ability to add value in the relationship, and valuation benchmarks. RIL Chairman, in the last AGM, said that active negotiations with Aramco were underway.  Q: What is your view on Reliance Retail and will it contribute more than the telecom segment, to total revenue in coming years?  RIL's retail business has ramped up faster than our estimates, particularly the store additions, in a challenging macro environment. While the near term outlook is tricky, given the 2nd wave of COVID and resultant impact on footfalls, we like RIL's approach of focusing on omni-channel offerings, and strengthening the supply chain, while ramping up the JioMart / digital sales channel. Our FY22ii EBITDA assumes normal operations for 3 quarters; FY23ii EBITDA growth of 25 percent YoY has upside, given the pace of current ramp up in operations. Our forecasts assume 23 percent-32 percent sales growth in FY22/23ii and EBITDA margins of 6.1/6.3 percent versus 5.5 percent seen in FY21ii.  RIL's proposed takeover of the retailing and logistics business assets of the Future group is facing legal issues, and awaits SC judgment. Future Retail's asset takeover will help RIL fast track its ambitions to grow the footprint in the organized retail segment. As such, the 26 percent per annum EBITDA growth forecast in the retail business is without integrating the assets of Future Retail. Takeover, if completed in the next 6-8 months, can add Rs 1,00,000-1,20,000 crore enterprise value to RIL's retailing business.  By FY23, we forecast Reliance Retail to register Rs 2,27,000 crore sales, and contribute 26 percent to the consolidated sales. These revenues would be almost 106 percent higher than estimated revenues of the telecom segment.

The key focus in the past several AGMs was largely on telecom and retail businesses which&nbsp;collectively&nbsp;provided revenue of Rs 2.44 lakh crore in FY21; experts believe this time&nbsp;will be no different.  In FY21, as per its targets, Reliance had the largest fundraise in Jio Platforms as well as Reliance Retail. Reliance Retail raised Rs 47,265 crore for a 10.09 percent stake from marquee global investors, while its telecom and digital services company Jio Platforms garnered Rs 1.52 lakh crore from several global investors including Google, Facebook and Intel.  In the last AGM, before stake sale in Reliance Retail,&nbsp;the company&nbsp;had raised a total of Rs 2,12,809 crore&nbsp;from Rights Issue, investments in Jio Platforms, and investment by BP, which largely helped the conglomerate become&nbsp;net-debt free, much ahead of its target of March 2021.  The company has been in the process to spin off its oil-to-chemical (O2C) business into a separate subsidiary. &amp;quot;The scheme for transfer of O2C undertaking to a wholly-owned subsidiary has been filed with the National Company Law Tribunal and is pending approval. The said scheme has been approved by the creditors and shareholders of the company,&amp;quot; said Reliance Industries in its FY21 earnings press release.

Also, announcements regarding&nbsp;the RIL-Aramco deal, the launch of 5G and new tech products &amp;amp;amp; services&nbsp;are expected in the AGM, Nair said.  RIL,&nbsp;in its recent earnings press release, said Jio was conducting field trials for fine-tuning network performance and configurations for its 5G network, and work was also ongoing on standardising 5G device configurations by collaborating with&nbsp;original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).  Reliance further said it has scaled up JioMart to become a truly horizontal platform with a presence across Grocery, Fashion &amp;amp;amp; Lifestyle, Digital and Pharma. In addition, JioMart has all the technological functionalities that should enable it to become&nbsp;a diverse third-party platform, it added.

","Mukesh Ambani-led&nbsp;Reliance Industries&nbsp;(RIL) will hold its 44th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on June 24, at 14 hours IST. The event is closely watched by Dalal Street and this time is expected to be no different.  RIL, which has a track record of meeting its target ahead of deadlines, is expected to make announcements&nbsp;across its&nbsp;telecom, retail and O2C business.  &amp;quot;In the upcoming AGM, Reliance is likely to announce kickstarting 5G services which might begin in late 2021. Moreover, 5G phones are likely to be revealed in the AGM which might be another interesting development to watch out for,&amp;quot; Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research told Moneycontrol.  In the last AGM, Chairman Mukesh Ambani said Jio designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch, enabling the company to launch a world-class 5G service in India, using 100 percent homegrown technologies and solutions.  &amp;quot;This Made-in-India 5G solution will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum is available&hellip; and can be ready for field deployment next year. And because of JIO's converged, all-IPnetwork architecture&hellip; we can easily upgrade our 4G network to 5G,&amp;quot;&nbsp;Ambani said.  &amp;quot;Once Jio's 5G solution is proven at India-scale, Jio Platforms would be well-positioned to be an exporter of 5G solutions to other telecom operators globally, as a complete managed service,&amp;quot; he added.  &amp;quot;We believe we can design entry-level 4 or even 5G smartphone&nbsp;for a fraction of its current cost. Through the partnership with Google, we are confident that we can accelerate the national mission of putting a smart device in the hands of every Indian.&amp;quot;  According to Gaurav Garg, JioBook, the low-cost laptops, is another attraction that might lure investors.  Garg said announcement over dividend declaration and bonus&nbsp;can also be expected&nbsp;in this AGM.  &amp;quot;Reliance likes to keep the market price of shares around Rs 1,000 so we might get to see 1:1 bonus announcement,&amp;quot; he said.  Earlier this month, Reliance Industries fixed June 14, 2021, as the record date for the purpose of determining the members eligible to receive the dividend for the financial year 2020-21.  The dividend, if declared at the AGM, will be paid within a week from the conclusion of the AGM, the company said.  Further, Gaurav Garg feels specific announcements are expected on the progress of Saudi Aramco deal in O2C business as well as Future Retail merger in the retail space.  The stock of RIL has rallied 12.1 percent&nbsp;so far in 2021. In the last 12 months, it has&nbsp;climbed 34.4 percent.

The upmove comes after the stock underperformed for almost&nbsp;five&nbsp;months versus broader markets. After reaching a high of Rs 2,369 a share in September 2020, the stock saw a correction of almost 22 percent and consolidated at around Rs 1,900,&nbsp;against this backdrop, the stock's upmove is notable.  What are the triggers for RIL going ahead?  The rally on May 28 can be attributed to several factors, including some non-fundamental elements, hence, we believe it is best not to analyse all these aspects in depth. Rather, we see three key drivers for the stock: 1) improving outlook on each business segment; 2) value unlocking in the O2C business and 3) inorganic growth initiatives.  1 Improving business outlook  The outlook for each of RIL's business segments is improving, and we forecast RIL's consolidated earnings to register&nbsp;CAGR (compound annual growth rate)&nbsp;of 19 percent through FY21-23ii. The growth is likely to be broad-based, rather than concentrated in any specific segment. During this period, we forecast the share of RIL's B2C businesses in overall EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at 53-58 percent versus 50 percent in FY21. Consider this:  a) O2C: Integration benefits will play now  RIL's O2C (oil-to-chemical) business is uniquely placed, given its refinery-petrochem integration. While we think petchem margins should soften relative to the current trends, gross refining margins (GRMs) should revive over the next 12 months, with pick up in global oil consumption. And, to that extent, we see low risk to our Rs 44,700 crore/Rs 47,500 crore EBITDA in the O2C segment through FY22ii/23ii, respectively.  If the global recovery is stronger in FY23, there is an upside risk to our estimates. However, it is too early to factor this in. The exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P)&nbsp; business, though relatively smaller compared to O2C, has also surprised positively. We factor-in KG D6 sales volumes of 15/18mmscmd through FY22/23ii, respectively, and assume no material changes in its realisations&mdash;around $4 per million British thermal unit (mmbtu).  b) Jio: Heads I win, tails you lose  The recently launched attractive Jio phone plans, the upcoming launch of Google phone and the capacity boost from the 45 percent increase in spectrum holdings after March auctions are likely to result in higher subscriber additions in the next few months (notwithstanding some weakness in April and May due to the second wave of COVID). We do not see significant price hikes in the next six months.  With Vi (Vodafone Idea) facing large cash outflows from December 2021, we forecast either industry-wide price hikes or an accelerated market-share loss for Vi, Jio stands to benefit in any case. Progress on the FTTH (fibre to the home) business remains steady. The key near-term trigger to watch out for would be the pricing of the smartphone to be launched in collaboration with Google and the plans.  Also read: Reliance Industries annual report key highlights: From strong liquidity to growth plans for Jio  c) Retail: Solid ramp up in operations  RIL's retail business, particularly store additions, has ramped up faster than our estimates in a challenging macro environment. While the near-term outlook is moot, given the second COVID wave and the resultant impact on footfalls, we like RIL&rsquo;s approach of focussing on omni-channel offerings and strengthening its supply chain, while ramping up the JioMart/digital sales channel.  Our FY22ii EBITDA assumes normal operations for three quarters; FY23ii EBITDA growth of 25 percent YoY has an upside, given the pace of the current ramp-up in operations. We, nonetheless, will wait for the current macro environment to phase out. Our forecasts assume 23&nbsp;percent and 32 percent sales growth estimates in FY22 ad FY23 and EBITDA margins of 6.1&nbsp;and 6.3 percent versus 5.5 percent seen in FY21ii.    RIL's reported net cash, as of FY21, stood at Rs 2,200 crore and adjusted for the deferred spectrum liabilities and creditors for Capex, net financial liabilities were seen at Rs 83,400 crore. We think that by FY22, RIL shall be able to prune the net debt by 69 percent to Rs 25,900 crore, given the completion of the rights issue and operational cash flows. As such, the capex intensity is incrementally lowering. Effectively by FY23, RIL should be a net-cash company, which bodes well for shareholders.  Also read: Reliance Industries sees big opportunity in global consensus against climate change  2 Value unlocking in O2C business  RIL is set to transfer its O2C business to a 100 percent subsidiary in FY22. The company is also well poised to induct a strategic investor in this business, which will fast-track its growth plans in the segment and meet the net carbon zero target by 2035.  In the base case, we value the business at an enterprise value (EV) of $63&nbsp;billion, and strategic stake sale to a global player such as Aramco at a higher valuation (eg $75&nbsp;billion) will help unlock the value.  3 Inorganic growth initiatives  RIL's proposed takeover of the retailing and logistics business assets of the Future Group is facing legal issues and awaits the Supreme Court judgment. FRL's (Future Retail) asset takeover will help RIL fast-track ambitions to grow its footprint in the organised retail segment.  As such, the 26 percent per annum EBITDA&nbsp;growth forecast in the retail business is without integrating the assets of FRL. Take over, if completed in the next six-eight months, can add Rs 1,00,000-1,20,000 crore EV to RIL&rsquo;s retailing business.  Also read: Jio accelerating rollout of digital platforms, indigenously-developed 5G stack: RIL annual report  What should investors do with RIL stock?  We maintain our positive bias on the stock. We value RIL's O2C business at $63&nbsp;billion; note that such valuation is lower by 16 percent versus the speculated $75-billion valuation attributed to the possible stake sale to ARAMCO.  IIFL's telecom&nbsp;team values Jio's EV at $82.9&nbsp;billion, which is based on discounted cash flow (DCF) and assumes revenue market share (RMS) of 51 percent in a steady state, post FY24.  We now value Reliance Retail at EV of $67&nbsp;billion, based on 35x FY23ii EBITDA. We are impressed by the pace of sales&nbsp;per EBITDA&nbsp;ramp-up at Reliance Retail and the faster-than-expected normalisation of operations would compel us to move the retail valuation even higher.  Reliance Retail successfully consummating the FRL acquisition could lead to significant value creation for the overall retail business. Our base case does not ascribe any option value for such a takeover. Against this backdrop, we value RIL at SoTP of Rs 2,200&nbsp;per share.  If RIL is able to induct a strategic investor at $75&nbsp;billion valuation, the SoTP (Sum of the parts) would move up by Rs 133&nbsp;per share; the FRL acquisition can lead to an uptick in SoTP by Rs 172&nbsp;per share over the next 12-18 months. And if the much-awaited increases in telecom ARPU come through (say tariff hikes of Rs 50 in the next 12-18 months), RIL's SoTP swings up by around Rs 200&nbsp;per share.    We reiterate our &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; rating on RIL and believe the stock will remain sensitive to news flow on the deal with ARAMCO and the Supreme Court verdict on Future Retail.

RIL said it has ramped up production of medical grade oxygen from zero to 1,000 metric tonne per day and is ensuring swift supply of the resource across states and Union Territories.  &ldquo;Traditionally, Reliance is not a manufacturer of medical grade liquid oxygen. Yet, starting from nil before the pandemic, Reliance Industries has now become India&rsquo;s largest producer of this life-saving resource from a single location,&rdquo; RIL said in a media statement.  &ldquo;At its refinery-cum-petrochemical complex in Jamnagar and other facilities, RIL now produces over 1,000 MT of medical grade liquid oxygen per day &mdash; or over 11 percent of India&rsquo;s total production &ndash; meeting the needs of nearly every one in ten patients,&rdquo; the company added.  This oxygen is being provided free of cost to several states across India &ldquo;to bring immediate relief to over 1 lakh patients&rdquo; each day, RIL said.  The conglomerate added that it had reconfigured and optimised its operations designed for refining and petrochemicals grade oxygen to produce high-purity medical grade oxygen despite not being a manufacturer of medical grade liquid oxygen before the pandemic.    Commenting on these initiatives, Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited, said: &ldquo;For me and for all of us at Reliance, nothing is more important than saving every life as India battles against a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an immediate need to maximise India&rsquo;s production and transportation capacities for medical grade oxygen. I am proud of our engineers at Jamnagar who have worked tirelessly, with a great sense of patriotic urgency, to meet this new challenge.&rdquo;  &ldquo;I am truly humbled by the determination and sense of purpose shown by the bright, young members of the Reliance family who have once again risen to the occasion and delivered when India needs it the most,&rdquo; Ambani added.  &amp;quot;Our country is going through an unprecedented crisis. We at Reliance Foundation will continue to do everything we can to help. Every life is precious.

Our thoughts and prayers are with our fellow countrymen and women. Together, we will overcome these difficult times,&rdquo; Nita Ambani, Founder-Chairperson of the Reliance Foundation, said.    Reliance said it had supplied over 55,000 MT of medical grade liquid oxygen across the country since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.  To overcome the transportation bottlenecks in supply, &ldquo;Reliance engineers made smart logistical modifications to rail and road transport, such as laying parallel lines, using hoses and loading up liquid tankers through pressure differential, since liquid oxygen pumps cannot be installed at short notice,&rdquo; the company said.  Nitrogen tankers were converted to transport trucks for medical grade oxygen through processes approved by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO), the relevant regulatory body of the Government of India, RIL added.  RIL also said it had organised airlifting of 24 ISO containers into India from Saudi Arabia, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Thailand adding 500 MT of new transportation capacity for liquid oxygen. &ldquo;These containers will help in removing the transport constraints for medical grade liquid oxygen in the country.&rdquo;  The company thanked Aramco, BP and the Indian Air Force (IAF) for their help in providing and transporting ISO containers, adding that more ISO containers will be airfreighted over the next few days.

In this year's study, the brokerage firm attempted to shortlist 25 stocks likely to deliver handsome returns over the next 25 years.  As per the brokerage firm, it made a list of 150 mid-cap companies i.e. companies that are ranked 101 to 250 by current market cap.  It preferred consumer-facing, secular business models and eliminated cyclical businesses like auto ancillaries, capital goods, chemicals, oil &amp;amp;amp; gas and realty which reduced the list of companies from 150 to 114.  To ensure the chosen firms are very profitable, the brokerage firm said it&nbsp;picked companies with last 5-year average RoE greater than 15 percent. This reduced the list from 114 to 63.  Next, it judged the business potential and management potential of the companies, and selected only those which qualified on both counts. This reduced the list from 63 to 28.  After that, the brokerage firm flagged off market leaders from the 28 companies to arrive at a list of 13 companies. Apart from these 13 companies, the brokerage chose 5 such companies from the list of 28 that are beneficiaries of value migration. In situations of value migration, all companies benefit irrespective of market leadership.  Now, the total shortlisted stocks were 18.  The brokerage firm said it chose only large-caps for financials and picked 6 leader names for the portfolio, now taking the total to 24.  At last, it opted for a pure digital play, even if it didn&rsquo;t meet some of the above filters, taking the total to 25.  &amp;quot;We believe in the very long run, valuations matter less.

The conversation on Day 1 of the two-day Facebook-hosted event revolved around opportunities in India, the way digital can accelerate economic progress, and how small businesses will be a key part of the global recovery going forward.  Read the full transcript of the conversation between Mukesh Ambani and Mark Zuckerberg below:&nbsp;  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I am sorry that we can't do this together in person, but we're excited to host the first-ever Facebook Fuel event in India. India is a very special and important country for us. Millions of people here use our products every day to stay in touch with friends and family. Whether it's a WhatsApp message, or a Facebook post, or photos on Instagram. And millions of small businesses across the country use WhatsApp business and Messenger to reach customers, manage orders, and grow their businesses. And in fact, we actually test some of our new features here first, before rolling them out globally. And speaking of tests, we just announced that we are hosting India&rsquo;s tour of Australia on demand on Facebook Watch. I am not exactly a sports guy myself, but I understand that that's quite a big deal here. And what I do know is that India is home to a lot of incredibly talented people. Now we see that in the folks that we recruit in our offices, both in India and at our headquarters, back in California. But this is more than just about Facebook because what happens in India here is important for the whole world as well. Prime Minister Modi's Digital India Vision, has opened up opportunities for the industry to partner with the government to accelerate growth and development through technology. And India is building local capabilities and tech capacity, to power innovative new business models and provide Indian citizens access to digital and financial inclusion. So, decisions that are made here, shape the global discussion about how technology can drive more economic opportunity and better outcomes for people. And a lot of Indian organizations are leading the way, and using technology to build safer communities and more inclusive financial systems. Whether it's in social commerce, or education or financial services, there is a lot of innovation that happens here, and we are proud to partner with some of the teams that are working on these important challenges. There's a very entrepreneurial culture here, that's quite remarkable. It's a great example of how access to better tools can unlock more opportunity for people, and we see that not just in the tech start-up scene, but millions and millions of small businesses that recognize the value that all these tools can provide. So, at Facebook, we like to say that we are in the business of serving small businesses. And nowhere is this more true than in India. This is especially important because small businesses here will be a key part of the global recovery going forward. And we are focused on making sure we build the best tools for them. So, this is part of a much broader conversation about how we can all make sure that tech delivers for everyone. And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to partner with Jio, which has played such a key role in giving hundreds of millions of Indians access to the benefits of the internet, everything that it can provide, and fostering this entrepreneurial culture. And with that, I am really glad to welcome Mukesh Ambani, the Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries, to talk about where things stand in terms of the country's digital transformation, and what we should expect in the years ahead. Mukesh, thank you very much for being here and let's get started.  Mukesh Ambani: Mark, first of all, congratulations to you and your team for organizing this Facebook Fuel for India event. I am sure this event will provide a lot of fuel of ideas to fire India&rsquo;s growth engine as you just described. The most powerful idea that can propel India&rsquo;s growth is that young people can create great enterprises and new businesses. And all the young Indian people see an inspiring young icon in Mark Zuckerberg. They are motivated when they see how in just 14 years, Facebook has become the face of a digitally connected India. So, let me begin by conveying my best wishes to the success of your dreams for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, I appreciate that. You know, so maybe today we should start with a topic that I know is top of mind for a lot of us, that is COVID-19 and the impact that it has had on all of our lives and communities. So, I am curious from your perspective, how is India doing right now? And when do you expect things are going to return to normal? And I know that Reliance has taken a number of big steps to help the community and help the country, and it's been a big year for you. So I am curious to hear, how did your company adapt to help move forward in the midst of this pandemic?  Mukesh Ambani: The sheer magnitude of COVID-19 pandemic, like everybody else in the world, did startle all of us in India. But then I think it is not in India&rsquo;s DNA to be deterred by a crisis. I firmly believe that a crisis is too precious to be wasted. Every crisis presents an opportunity for new growth, and India has faced the COVID crisis with enormous resilience and resolve. Prime Minister Modi has led India from the front, and while we are not as rich a country as some of our western counterparts, being fiscally prudent, he has taken steps to take care of our vulnerable. We have given free food for right up to December of this year, to over 800 million Indians. 200 million citizens in India are getting direct cash transfer of Rs. 1500 in their bank account - that is the digitally connected India. And now we are ready and pretty much at par with the world, to roll out one of the largest vaccine programs in the first half of 2021, under Prime Minister's leadership. We at Reliance and Reliance Foundation, have also taken steps. As you know, Reliance has over 350,000 employees across the length and breadth of India and we have taken steps to protect over 2 million in our family and the community around them. In Mumbai, we have built a hospital just dedicated to COVID-19. We have Life Sciences as part of our business, so we have tested up early on - we have really ramped up testing, and we believe that testing helped in tracing and isolation, and at least reduced fatalities in our communities to a very low level. We have produced PPEs. We are in the textile business in Reliance, and India did not have&hellip;we used to import all our protective gear from the external world. In a matter of months, we at Reliance, produced a hundred thousand PPE's, and we are now exporters from India and this happened during the COVID time. And most importantly in the early days, when we were little stuck, we at the Reliance Foundation, distributed 55 million, one of the largest meal distribution programs for the vulnerable, in all the states and villages. So, we have played our part. And as far as Jio is concerned, we had our own dedicated team. And I could tell you that, we had never imagined that we would all work from home and the network traffic grew multiple percentage and none of us stepped out. But we could maintain 99% availability, so that Indians could work from home, shop from home, study from home, and remain connected to the rest of the world. You know, Mark, sometimes I wonder that if the pandemic had struck India just four or five years earlier, we would not have been in as good a shape as what we are today, with all the connectivity we have. The credit for that must go to our Prime Minister's Digital India vision, where he motivated the entire industry to roll out broadband in the first five years of his first term. And during the pandemic, India has attracted the largest foreign direct investment in its history. Mark, we have our own example of how Jio and Facebook concluded our partnership right in the middle of lockdown. And let me tell you with utmost sincerity, that we at Reliance and Jio, immensely value our partnership with Facebook. Thank you for your faith in Jio. Thank you, Mark, for your faith in India. I have no hesitation in going on record, that it is your investment that set the ball rolling. Not only for Jio but for the Indian FDI which has been the largest-ever in its history. And our partnership between Jio and Facebook will actually demonstrate that it is great for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses. And I believe Mark, that our actions will speak louder than our words in the coming months and years.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you. So, you know, one of the big opportunities that I see with this Facebook and Jio partnership is the role that we can play together in supporting the millions of small businesses in India, especially now with the impact that COVID is having, in accelerating the move of businesses from physical storefronts to digital ones in this digital future. So, I am curious what role do you see technology playing in this post-COVID world, especially as it relates to all of these small businesses. I know you share a passion with me that it is just critical that we serve them.  Mukesh Ambani: Absolutely, Mark. And let me point out a very unique feature about our partnership. Perhaps not many people have understood this. Because, before this partnership I believe that each one of us was mainly a communication platform. Together, we now have become a value creation platform for our customers and small businesses. And I firmly believe that technology, all the digitisation steps that India has taken will democratise wealth and value creation for individuals and small businesses. And let me explain this very simply. WhatsApp has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio Mart, which is our retail service, has the aspiration of serving tens of millions of small shopkeepers in India, who are the bedrock of employment. So what does this mean? This means Jio brings digital connectivity, WhatsApp now with WhatsApp Pay brings digital interactivity, and the ability to move to close transactions and create value and Jio Mart brings the unmatched online and offline retail opportunity, that gives our small shops which exist in villages and small towns in India, a chance to digitize and be at par with anybody else in the world. To my mind, more wealth creation means more employment and more business. And together with our platforms and the tools that we will provide to small businesses and to individual consumers, I believe will drive India to a 5 trillion economy and will make a much more equal India, with more equal wealth growth at the bottom of the pyramid. You know, Mark, I firmly believe that in the next two decades, India will grow to be among the top three economies in the world. But more importantly, it will become a premier digital society. It will be a modern society with young people driving it, with young businesses driving it. And our per capita income will go from eighteen hundred - two thousand dollars per capita, to five thousand dollars per capita. Our mid-income or the middle class in India which is about 50% of its total number of households, will grow to three to four percent per year. And I think that Facebook, Jio, and a lot of other companies and entrepreneurs in the world, have a golden opportunity to be in India, to be part of this economic and social transformation, that we are witnessing and that will accelerate in the coming decades.  Mark Zuckerberg: I completely agree, and your company has already done so much to help fuel this. Reliance brought about the 4G revolution in India, and I know that 5G now is another big focus for you. But what your company has done here I think, has been truly remarkable in helping to bring hundreds of millions of people onto the internet and bringing opportunity. And I&rsquo;m curious, as you look ahead to the future in India, what other technologies or developments are you excited about now? And where do you see the country in the next five to ten years?  Mukesh Ambani: Well, as I mentioned to you Mark, I really see India accelerating as a premier digital society. I see us integrating both 5G&hellip;and just yesterday, our Prime Minister has said that, he wants every village and every gram panchayat&hellip;India has 680,000 villages, and we have a population of 1.3 billion people, and he wants everybody to be empowered on the information highway with high speed fix broadband, and which is happening. We also think that compute and very low latency compute is real. I think that there is a great opportunity for really bringing education and health care. With the second-generation reforms that were done in the last six months, we have unique opportunities and as Jio we are connecting all the 1.9 million schools in India and the 58 000 colleges. At any point in time, we will have in the coming decades, about 200 million children or young adults, between the age of 3 and 18 in our education system. I think that in a span of 10 years, we can set for ourselves an objective really to reskill India and the talent that you talked about, can improve 10x. Today, you're just seeing the creamy layer, but that's what technology can do to really make a better India and a better world. The same thing we can do in health and all the emerging technology and integrations, where we can make sure that we deliver services, and we deliver good proactive health. We've learned that and I think we're going to use technology. We are working very closely with all the authorities to make sure that we provide the technology tools and backbone for even vaccination in the coming quarters using technology. So, I think health, education&hellip;.we've already&hellip; and I think that what India has done is in a sense, we have democratized value creation with the drive of our Prime Minister. And you can see it in payments, you will see it in terms of making sure that technology is easily available and we made it affordable, so that millions of millions of people, even at this lower per capita basis can use this in a large market. And with that finally, I really see the enterprise and the enthusiasm of young Indians, their aspirations, and their confidence that is really driving India. And that is why I think that the next two decades are going to be historic in terms of the social and economic transformation.  Mark Zuckerberg: That makes sense. You, of course, already talked about commerce and driving small businesses and entrepreneurship. It always blows me away that India has more than 60 million small businesses, and millions of people around the country rely on them for jobs and that's a big part of what I hope that our partnership can serve here. We support more than 50 million WhatsApp business app users globally every month already. And more than 15 million of these are in India. So you know with communities around the world now in lockdown there are a lot of these entrepreneurs who need digital tools that they can rely on to find and communicate with customers and grow their businesses. And now this is just something that I think that our partnership can really help with. And of course, beyond the impact on small businesses.I just think that this year has reminded us of how essential technology can be as a tool for people, to just connect with each other. Whether it's using the networks that your companies have established, or the tools that we've built to be able to have that human connection, and find important information. And as you said, I can't imagine going through the pandemic 10 years ago, two decades, when the internet was still nascent. It should have been a completely different experience. And technology, of course, is allowing us to make sure we can get accurate information out to people that has implications in health, like you're talking about, in education and helping serve people better. And I think it shows a lot of the promise for what's ahead and I think we've certainly fared better now, than we would have if the pandemic had hit us before.  Mukesh Ambani: I couldn't agree more, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: You know, going back to Reliance, one of the great business stories in history, your father founded Reliance Industries and he has this incredible legacy here in India. And now I&rsquo;ve read that, he once held up a postcard in his office and said, if every Indian could speak with each other at the cost of this postcard, where will India be? And now your father clearly had a vision for where things were heading in the country, and because today Indians can communicate with one another for less than the cost of a postcard, and that's what we've tried to do with messaging&hellip;and hopefully we can do that together with payments and make it so people can use India's new UPI system, which I think is just great. It's a tremendous public good that the government has put out there. But I am curious, before we get into UPI and more on that, what's the most important thing that you learned from your father and his legacy, that has helped you build these amazing businesses and get to where they are today?  Mukesh Ambani: So Mark, thank you for those kind words on my father. Just so that when he motivated us in 2000, in terms of saying, can you make voice at the cost of a postcard? In 2020, we're very proud that Jio has pioneered free voice. So, all the 400 million people are a tribute to his vision. They are on our network and have a free voice. And as you said, my father was a son of a school teacher. He came to Mumbai with just a thousand rupees in 1960 and established Reliance with a belief that I will invest in businesses of the future, and I will invest in talent. And, for all the young people at Reliance and across India, I repeat my learnings in terms of building Reliance, three basic tenets really. One is, for entrepreneurs, it's important to have courage and self-belief. There can be no better person to demonstrate that in the last couple of decades than you, Mark. So you know, all of us believe that we have to believe in ourselves. And all of us know as entrepreneurs that we don't succeed at the first attempt, and self-belief comes to you when you fail. And self-belief increases your confidence when you succeed. So, courage and self-belief is something that I always tell entrepreneurs, remember that it's important. The second piece that he started and he's instilled into all of us is that, while you succeed, it's important to always have empathy and creativity in everything that you do. And by empathy, I mean, put yourself in the other's shoe, and make sure that how you make them feel is how you would want to feel. At Reliance, we do that at many levels now - we care for our employees, our investors, society, environment, and above all national interests of India. You know, within creativity&hellip;.and I always give this example in terms of saying that, when Reliance needed to grow, capital markets were not there. It was the 1980s, and my father came up by saying, I will actually share shares of Reliance, which was never done in the private sector. In the 80s, the first AGM of Reliance was in a football ground, and we had 60,000 shareholders. You and I both do annual general meetings. And his AGM in the 1980s for Reliance was in a football ground and he said, my purpose is really to win investor&rsquo;s confidence. Since then, creativity and empathy are critical as you go along. And the final thing that I have learned from my father, is really the importance of relationship, trust, and loyalty. The whole of Reliance right now, with hundreds of thousands of people, is one big family. We're not related by birth, but we are really woven together by passion, purpose, and conviction. We have faith in one another. We are loyal to one another, to this large Reliance family. For us, it's always one for all, and all for one. And I hope that a lot of people around the world can relate to this. That's what we believe at Reliance and for all of us at Reliance, he will still be the founder, if we follow his vision in terms of investing in businesses of the future. Mark, now that brings me to questions for you. Mark, what made you believe in India and the Jio story? As I said, you started this FDI avalanche in India, and the world recognized when Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, in the middle of lockdown said, I am going to bet on India and I&rsquo;m going to make even in this uncertain times, one of the largest foreign direct investments in India. What do you think of the digital network that you are clearly&hellip;.I call you the architect of the digital network of the world. While I have built some connectivity and broadband connectivity in India, you've done that for the world. Please share with us your experience as the digital architect of the world, how your global Facebook has helped people in this crisis, and your perspective of the crisis, and where you see the world today, and where it is going after you just explain to us what you&rsquo;ve done in India?  Mark Zuckerberg: Your words are incredibly generous. And we started this to help give people a tool to stay connected with their friends, and then expand to friends and family and communities, and a lot of this just ends up being a universal human phenomenon. No matter what country you're in, you know everyone cares about their friends and family, and their communities, and wants to stay connected. And what we've seen is that, India is actually home to the largest communities in the world, across Facebook and WhatsApp and getting there on Instagram, as well. So, we see the vitality and the entrepreneurship, and the creativity of businesses, and how much people want to connect, and you see a tremendous number of people coming online, a lot of that&hellip;thanks to your investments, and the work that you've done to enable hundreds of millions of people to come online here. And I just see a very promising future in India. We talked briefly about how there's a big trend of financial inclusion ahead, and how the ease of payments is going to be such a big deal for commerce, and giving people self-reliance and control of their own destiny, and a lot of that. We just launched WhatsApp payments in India last month - now you can send money to your friends and family through WhatsApp, as easily as sending a message. That was possible because of the UPI system that has been built in India. Unified Payments Interface, makes it easy for anyone to instantly accept payments across different apps. I think we're working with 140 banks or it's supported by 140 banks. India is the first country in the world to do anything like this. So, we're grateful to be able to support this kind of innovation and to help to work, to create more prosperity, and help achieve a more Digital India. And frankly, I think that a lot of other places around the world are going to be better off when they follow some of this lead that India has set, in creating public goods like this. So there's really a tremendous amount to be inspired by, with what is going on in India now. And we're just grateful to be able to serve our community here, and help people stay connected with the people they care about but also, create economic opportunity as well.  Mukesh Ambani: Thanks Mark, as you said, we are looking forward to your involvement and innovation in India, creating benefit for hundreds of millions of people and then taking this innovation to the rest of the world. I hope that the rest of the world learns from Indian policy, and what Facebook is able to achieve in India. And we as Indians will be very proud, if Facebook says we did it first in India, and then took it to 100 countries. And I look forward to working with you on that. Mark, all of us would love to know your views on how the world is changing, and what you and Facebook are thinking about it, and what you see the future as. Just give us your perspective, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: I think that there are a number of very important trends, but maybe I'll just talk about two. So, one is that, I think technology is giving individuals&rsquo; power and opportunities that were previously only held by large organizations. So, we've spent a lot of time today talking about small businesses, but one of the things that I think is so powerful about the internet is it makes it so that individual entrepreneurs and small businesses can now have access to the same kind of tools for reaching new customers and doing sophisticated analytics and communication that previously only bigger companies would have been able to build up the capacity to do that. And individuals can now share their ideas online, and get access to information in ways that previously only wealthier people or larger organizations would have had the capacity to share their ideas, or get access to information at that kind of scale. And overall, I think that just makes people's lives better. It's incredibly empowering and it's incredibly democratizing. India being the world's largest democracy, I think it really makes sense to lead there, because just empowering individuals, which I know is something that you believe deeply in as well, is just going to be a huge part of what will hopefully create a lot of prosperity, as you mentioned in the decades ahead. The other thing that I&rsquo;m excited about is more of a technological vision for the future. There are a lot of interesting technologies, but one trend that I focus a lot on is that as people we're always looking to connect with other people and share our experiences in the richest way that we can. So, if you look back to the beginning of the internet, most of the internet was text. We would text each other, chat, share our experiences but then connections got better. And then we got to photos being the primary way that we shared. And you know the old saying, a picture is worth a thousand words. Now, a lot of sharing is through photos and we're now on the next step with 4G and coming 5G networks - video is really becoming the primary way that people share. Anyone can largely capture something on their phones and can share it or stream it, and increasingly, people are able to consume that. And video is just a lot richer of a medium than photos even can be. When my daughters took her first steps, I wanted to capture a video of that and share it, not just a photo. But I don't think video is the end of the line. So, a lot of what I am focused on is helping to create virtual reality and augmented reality. So that way we can share not only a video of an experience, but you can use virtual reality to go into an experience and feel like you're right there. You can have holograms of digital objects that can kind of be as realistic as the physical objects that are there. Maybe you know, in five or ten years, when we're having this conversation, just a hologram version of me will be sitting on the couch next to you, instead of having to do this over a screen. And it'll feel a lot more realistic. So, I just think that's going to be incredibly powerful. And the power of virtual and augmented reality is they deliver the sense of a presence. You feel like you're right there with another person, which really will be the ultimate in human connection, and it will give people the opportunity to work and to connect, no matter where they want to be. So that's something that we're very focused on and invested in. And I&rsquo;m just very excited for the future. And on that note, let me just wrap up and just say again how grateful I am for everything that you and your companies do, and for the partnership. I do think that in so many ways, not just Jio and the technology platforms, but the other businesses that you've built, you've had such a positive impact on improving the quality of lives for hundreds of millions of Indians. A big part of why I was excited to partner with you is, there are not many people around the world who've just gone industry after industry and revolutionized them and improved them, and continue to do it, and have that hunger to improve the lives of so many people. So, I just have a deep admiration for that. And I am really looking forward to working together over the coming years and decades to make sure we can serve the people in India as well as possible. And hopefully, a lot of those advances will be expanded outside of India as well, to help people around the world. But I am incredibly grateful for your partnership on this. Thank you for joining me for this inaugural Facebook Fuel event today.  Mukesh Ambani: Thank you very much, Mark. And thank you for sharing your awesome vision of the future. You started this with saying that on Facebook, you would see the India - Australia cricket match, I look forward to a day when Facebook will take me with everything that you explained on virtual reality, where I will be sitting in Mumbai and be in a stadium in Australia. And I&rsquo;m sure that day, with your digital architecture and leadership, is not far away. Thank you so very much for having me.

Reliance Retail also said its success in bringing such a huge repertoire of traditional handcrafted products to its modern retail formats is also an indication of the existence of demand for such products, as long as consumers&rsquo; expectations of quality, style, and convenience of modern retail buying can be met.  The fashion and lifestyle arm of Reliance said its 'Indie range' (Indie by AJIO) is sourced from over 50 GI crafts clusters from across Indian states - including Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.  With this geographical indication tag, natural produce, handicrafts, or manufactured goods are identified native to a territory, region, or locality for their unique characteristics.  &amp;quot;The diversity of sourcing from across the length and breadth of India has resulted not only in the creation of a stunning portfolio that is every handcraft connoisseur&rsquo;s dream, but also in the direct employment for over 30,000 skilled artisans across the country. We will continue to grow this segment with time,&amp;quot; Akhilesh Prasad said.  Reliance Retail's other brand 'Swadesh' has an MoU with the Ministry of Textiles which enables the sourcing of 100 percent authentically crafted products, directly from artisan communities.

Here's what he said,"Reliance Industries (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani on November 21 spoke at&nbsp;the 8th Convocation of Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU).  Here's what Ambani said during the virtual address:  Honourable Chief Minister of Gujarat, Shri Vijay Rupaniji, my fellow members of the Board, faculty, teachers, staff, students, parents, and my dear friends,  A very warm good morning to each and every one of you. I wish all of you good health and safety. I hope that you are all taking necessary precautions to keep yourself and your dear ones safe and protected.  India has entered a crucial phase in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot afford to let our guards down at this juncture.  We are extremely privileged to have the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, Sh Narendrabhai Modi, as the chief guest for today&rsquo;s event. His passionate and dynamic leadership has made the world sit up and take notice of the emergence of a New India.  His confidence and conviction have inspired and galvanised the entire nation.  I am sure that the bold reforms introduced under his leadership will pave the way for India&rsquo;s swift recovery and rapid economic progress in the years to come.  Friends, all of us know that PDPU itself is a product of Honourable Prime Minister Narendrabhai's &amp;quot;Atmanirbhar&amp;quot; vision.  It is a vision he cherished even when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat...to make India self-reliant in the areas of Energy, Energy Education, Research and Innovation.  PDPU is only fourteen years old. Yet, it already ranks among the Top-25 in the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements.  In terms of diversity, we attract international students from across the world. We have 284 international students from 39 countries.  And from a total of 132 students in the first convocation in 2009, we have 2,608 students, including 46 PhDs, graduating today.  From National Rankings, I am sure PDPU will soon earn a place in global rankings.  My dear teachers, PDPU has world-class physical infrastructure. But what gives me far greater joy is that PDPU has world-class faculty as well. Your dedication and commitment to excellence has been exemplary.  In the best practice of India's Guru Parampara, you have always gone beyond the call of duty. You have been friends, guides and mentors to your students. Let's take a moment to appreciate the leadership, faculty and all the staff of PDPU.  Friends, today I have a special reason to applaud PDPU. The COVID-19 pandemic has cast a shadow on the academic lives and careers of students across the world.  Precious hours of academic engagement, debate and research have been lost in lockdowns. Yet, our very own PDPU did exceptionally well even in these challenging times.  The flame of teaching and learning at PDPU shone brightest even during the darkest days of the pandemic. Our faculty continued to present award-winning research papers in national and international conferences. Our students continued to enjoy co-curricular and extra-curricular activities held digitally.  These facts make me proud of our university. But my heart swelled with greater pride when I learnt that PDPU also contributed to the nation's fight against COVID-19. Our teachers and students designed several medical equipment, including an ICU ventilator.  I salute the leadership of PDPU for combining Jnana with Seva. This combination is the greatest badge of honour for any educational institution.  Dear members of the PDPU Community, our accomplishments so far have been a source of joy.  However, we have to prepare ourselves to scale still higher summits of success.  The future of energy is being shaped by unprecedented changes. And these changes are impacting the future of humanity &mdash; indeed, the very future of our planet.  The most important question we face is this:  Can we produce the growing amounts of energy we need to sustain our economies without harming the environment?...Without failing to fulfil our climate change obligations? We must be prepared to answer this question with a CONFIDENT &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot;!  By the middle of this century, the world will use twice as much energy as we use today. In the next two decades, India&rsquo;s own per-capita energy needs will be more than twice as much as today.  Therefore, India is required to simultaneously pursue two goals: To become an economic superpower. To become a green and clean energy superpower.  To achieve these twin goals, we need disruptive solutions in renewables, low carbon and carbon recycle technologies. We need breakthroughs in new energy sources such as green and blue hydrogen. We also need great innovations in energy storage, saving and utilisation.  As a person from the energy business, I can assure the students and faculty of PDPU that you are entering an exciting future.  What makes it even more exciting is the synergy between the Energy Revolution and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. If we master this synergy, we will surely be able to make India one of the most prosperous nations in the world. An India that guarantees prosperity and wellbeing for all 1.3 billion Indians.  Honourable Chief Minister Shri Rupani ji, Gujarat is a trailblazer state. It has always shown the pioneer spirit. Today the entire world acknowledges that NEW GUJARAT has paved the path for NEW INDIA. The visionary leadership of Shri Narendra Modi ji that Gujarat received is now available to the nation.  I must compliment you and your team for making Vibrant Gujarat even more vibrant under the guidance of Shri Modi ji and Shri Amit Shah ji.  Here is our solemn assurance to you today. PDPU will continue to make its unique contribution to enhancing the reputation of Gujarat and India in energy education and research.  My dear Young Graduates, I see in you, 2,608 future builders of a strong, proud and vibrant India. My heartiest congratulations to you on your success. May all your dreams come true as you embark on a new journey in your life.  However, always remember an important life lesson. Learning is a constant and never-ending process of exploration, discovery and adventure. A true student never stops the pursuit of knowledge.  Therefore, here is my message to you, and I am only repeating Mahatma Gandhi's wise words: &amp;quot;Learn for life, Learn through life, and Learn throughout life&amp;quot;.  I have another message for you. When you step out of this beautiful campus, you will no doubt carry wonderful memories with you.  But perhaps you will also carry some concern, some uncertainty, some anxiety about the future.  This is only natural. The COVID situation will likely accentuate your thoughts and feelings.  Therefore, I would like to tell you with great emphasis today...venture out with supreme hope and confidence. The future is very bright for India, for you, and for all Indians.  This, our ancient nation, has faced many adversities in the past. And has emerged stronger each time. This is because resilience is in the very DNA of Indian people, Indian culture.  In the post-COVID era, I clearly foresee explosive and exponential growth in the Indian economy. Within a couple of decades, India will be among the top three economies in the world.  Growth will create unprecedented opportunities and possibilities for young and talented people like you. Indeed, most of these opportunities will be created by young entrepreneurs themselves. I see many amongst you as the creators of successful startups.  The world is waiting for you. Step out and take the plunge. Fail, if necessary, but in pursuit of your dreams. With passion, purpose and persistent effort, your dreams will indeed come true.  We, at PDPU, take pride in now calling you our alumni &ndash; our ambassadors. Make all of us at PDPU proud. Make your parents proud. Make India proud.  Once again, my hearty congratulations to the Class of 2019 and 2020. Good luck and God bless.  Thank you.

The acquisition is being done as part of a scheme in which Future Group is merging certain companies carrying on the aforesaid businesses into Future Enterprises Ltd (FEL).  The announcement comes as a setback to Amazon.com which has claimed that Future Group violated its agreement with the US e-commerce giant by entering into the deal with RIL.

The SIAC passed the interim order asking Future Group to hold its plans of selling its retail business to RIL on October 25.&nbsp;  Amazon, last year, had bought a 49 per cent stake in one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd, with the right to buy into FRL after a period between three and 10 years. Future Coupons owned a 7.3 per cent stake in Future Retail.  Along with this, Amazon even wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and CCI seeking a stay on the deal.

Consolidated quarterly net profits once again were back to above Rs 10,000 crore level (or Rs 40,000 crore annualized run-rate).

","Labelling India as an extraordinary country growing at an incredible scale, energy supermajor BP Plc on&nbsp;October 26 said it is looking to expand its presence in the nation in fuel retailing and mobility solutions, but wanted natural gas to be included in the GST regime. Speaking at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, BP Group chief executive Bernard Looney said his firm in partnership with Reliance Industries Ltd will in the next 4-5 years set up 5,500 retail sites that will not just sell petrol and diesel but also offer mobility solutions like EV charging facility.  &amp;quot;India is an extraordinary country with an extraordinary history, an extraordinary group of people, and with extraordinary ambition,&amp;quot; he said, adding the country has a growing population, and an ambitious agenda to cut emissions. This, he said, was &amp;quot;very, very compelling&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Why is India important, because it is India,&amp;quot; he said, adding energy mix in the country could fall from 50 percent coal to 40 percent, while gas and renewables will grow. Looney said India will be the fastest-growing fuel and lubricant market in the next 20 years and his group's venture with Reliance will grow the network of petrol pumps to 5,500 in the next 4-5 years from the current 1,400.  As many as 80,000 jobs will be created in the building of the network, he said, adding the venture will offer mobility solutions under the Jio-BP brand. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports. These have been taken over by the RIL-BP joint venture and will be grown in the future. While petrol pumps will be expanded to 5,500, aviation refuelling facilities will grow to 45. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports.  RIL holds 51 percent in the new joint venture company, while BP has the remaining 49 percent. BP paid about Rs 7,000 crore to acquire the 49 percent stake. This is the third joint venture between Reliance and BP since 2011.  BP had in 2011 bought a 30 percent stake in 21 oil and gas exploration and production blocks of Reliance for $7.2 billion. At that time, another 50:50 joint venture, India Gas Solutions, was set up for sourcing and marketing gas in India. RIL-BP is investing $5 billion in developing the next set of discoveries in the KG Basin D6 block.  &amp;quot;Our production with Reliance will account for 15 percent of India gas production,&amp;quot; he said. Looney said while the company feels the ease of doing business on the ground, India is a complex market.  GST was a welcome federal initiative to ease trade and it will be good if natural gas is included in that. When Goods and Services Tax (GST), which amalgamated 17 different central and state levies like excise duty and VAT, was implemented in July 2017, five products &ndash; petrol, diesel, crude oil, aviation turbine fuel, and natural gas, were kept out of its purview for the time being.  This meant that gas users could not set off tax paid on inputs against those on the final product and tax on tax continued, disincentivising the use of the fuel. He said BP has a &amp;quot;deep, trusting relationship&amp;quot; with Mukesh Ambani, chairman of RIL.  On the impact of COVID-19 on oil demand, he said it was too early to say what the true impact was but there would be some impact in the medium to long term. But communities around the world are demanding more affordable, reliable, and clean energy and BP was committed to providing solutions for the same, he said.  Speaking at the same event, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said India is one of the largest markets in the world for energy, but its per capita consumption is just 30 percent of the world average, offering huge potential. &amp;quot;We want to be an important part of India,&amp;quot; he said, adding the French group is investing in setting up LNG import terminal, city gas expansion, and renewable energy projects in the country.

In an interview with PTI, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) Chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said the intention is to become energy company of the country and not just be restricted to selling petroleum products.  IOC, which controls over 40 percent of India&rsquo;s diesel-dominated petroleum product market, recently introduced differentiated LPG for industrial users that gives flame temperature that is 80 percent higher than conventional cooking gas, thereby cutting down cooking time and saving 5-8 percent on fuel.  Also, the company has introduced hydrogen-spiked CNG that will give BS-VI (equivalent to Euro-VI) emissions from BS-IV vehicles, he said.  &amp;quot;Eventually we intend to become energy company of India and not just be restricted to selling petroleum products,&rdquo; he said.  &amp;quot;The world is changing. We intend to set up EV charging points and battery swapping stations at our petrol pumps alongside offering auto-LPG and conventional fuels. So it will be a bouquet of offering.&rdquo;  &amp;quot;Eventually we intend to become energy company of India and not just be restricted to selling petroleum products,&rdquo; he said.  IOC has already set up EV-charging points at 76 petrol pumps and battery-swapping facilities at 11 outlets.  It is also evaluating different advanced battery technologies and intends to set up a metal-air battery-manufacturing facility for EVs as well as for stationary applications.  Vaidya said being the biggest retailer, IOC faces the threat of losing market share to any new entrant.  &amp;quot;We understand that and so we are now focusing on the way we do retail,&rdquo; he said.  All the 29,800 petrol pumps of the company have been fully automated and their look and feel enhanced to match private-sector competition.  &amp;quot;Now, we are damn sure of giving Q&amp;amp;amp;Q, that is quality and quantity,&rdquo; he said.  &amp;quot;With automation done, we can guarantee that. And we now have look and feel to match anybody.&rdquo;  Public sector firms dominate India&rsquo;s fuel market but new entrants such as Nayara Energy have been chipping at their market share.  Also, Reliance Industries has renewed its interest in fuel retailing through a joint venture with UK supermajor BP Plc.  Adani Group too is eyeing the segment through a tie-up with TOTAL of France.  Public sector firms dominate India&rsquo;s fuel market but new entrants such as Nayara Energy have been chipping at their market share.  Vaidya said IOC has strong research and development (R&amp;amp;amp;D) that is bringing to market differentiated fuels.  The company has got encouraging response for its recently launched differentiated LPG and will now go for expanding its reach, he said.  &amp;quot;We have launched a differentiated LPG with the brand name Indane 'Xtra Tej&rsquo; last month for non-domestic customers. It will yield approx 5-8 percent savings in fuel consumption over normal LPG,&rdquo; he said.  Also, the company has introduced CNG spiked with 18 percent hydrogen that eliminates the need for replacing the old BS-IV fleet of vehicles as it gives emissions compliant with superior BS-VI grade, he said adding H-CNG is being dispensed from one outlet in the national capital and would soon be extended to others.  IOC has also established itself as the second-largest player in natural gas in India with a licence to retail CNG and piped cooking gas in 40 Geographical Areas.  &amp;quot;We are also aggressively promoting the use of compressed biogas, 2-G ethanol, and biodiesel produced from used cooking oil, besides integrating our refinery processes with biofuels production,&rdquo; he said.  But the fuel business is prone to volatilities that squeeze margins.  To de-risk the business, IOC plans to add petrochemical plants at all of its nine oil refineries, he said.  But the fuel business is prone to volatilities that squeeze margins.  &amp;quot;This would de-risk the fuel business. We realise that the volatility of the market can be easily controlled by having a good footprint in the petrochemical sector,&rdquo; he said.  &amp;quot;Petroleum fuels continue to be my main business as far as turnover is concerned, but profitability I intend to get from petrochemicals.&amp;quot;  The petrochemical intensity &ndash; the percentage of crude oil converted into chemicals- is low at 5-6 percent currently.  &amp;quot;We intend to take it up to 10-12 percent,&rdquo; he said.  The petrochemical intensity &ndash; the percentage of crude oil converted into chemicals- is low at 5-6 percent currently.  The firm&rsquo;s newer refineries at Panipat in Haryana and Paradip in Odisha have the petrochemical intensity of 15-20 percent which would be raised to 25 percent, he said adding all-India average being targeted is 10-12 percent.

According to Ambani, during the third industrial revolution, when information technology came to prominence, India joined the race but still remained behind, trying to catch up with the leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;quot;As we step into the fourth industrial revolution, India has the opportunity, not just to catch up with the leaders but to emerge as a global leader itself,&amp;quot; he added.  Read the full text of Mukesh Ambani's speech below:  Distinguished Leaders and Attendees,   Greetings from India.  Let me first wish all of you, and your dear ones, the best of health and safety.  I want to thank Nik, Steffen and TM Forum for inviting me to talk about the journey of Jio and our vision for India&rsquo;s digital future.  Friends,  India missed out on the first two industrial revolutions and the changes brought about by them.  During the third industrial revolution, where Information Technology came to prominence, India joined the race but still remained behind, trying to catch up with the leaders.  As we step into the fourth industrial revolution, India has the opportunity, not just to catch up with the leaders but to emerge as a global leader itself.  The Fourth Industrial Revolution is driven by the convergence of digital and physical technologies&hellip; such as Digital connectivity, Cloud and Edge computing, IoT and smart devices, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Blockchain, AR/VR and genomics.  And the three foundational requirements needed to participate in this revolution are ultra-high-speed connectivity, affordable smart devices and transformational digital applications and solutions.  Jio was conceived for India to enable this journey.  Let me first talk about connectivity&hellip;  Before Jio, India was stuck with 2G technology&hellip;  And Jio wanted to end India&rsquo;s data misery and unleash a digital revolution.  We built a world-class, all-IP, future-proof digital network that delivers the highest speeds and the best coverage across India.  While it took 25 years for the Indian telecom industry to build its 2G network, Jio built its 4G network only in three years.  And to ensure widespread adoption of data, we launched with the lowest data tariffs in the world&hellip; and made voice services completely free for Jio users.  Second, let me talk about devices&hellip;  Before Jio&hellip; over half a billion Indians were left out of the digital movement because they couldn&rsquo;t afford smartphones and had to make do with 2G feature phones.  Our young and talented Jio engineers rose to the challenge of designing the world&rsquo;s ultra-affordable breakthrough device called the JioPhone.  That provided a window to the world of limitless possibilities for over 100 million Indians in less than a year.  Third, let me now talk about digital applications and solutions.  Right from day one, Jio offered a bouquet of mobile applications and solutions that offered our customers rich content&hellip; spanning Live TV, Movies, Music, News, Magazines&hellip; in addition to other apps that addressed collaboration, financial services, payments and so on.  When we combined digital connectivity, digital devices and digital applications and solutions &hellip; the results were amazing.  Adding customers at a mind-boggling rate of seven customers every second, Jio garnered 100 million customs in just 170 days of its launch.  And India&rsquo;s monthly consumption went up from 0.2 billion GB to 1.2 billion GB&hellip; a growth of 600%... and data consumption has been multiplying ever since.  Today, India consumes over 6 exabytes of data every month&hellip; more than 30 times pre-Jio levels, just four years ago.  We have gone from 155th in the world to number ONE in mobile data consumption&hellip; in JUST FOUR years.  The Jio movement shattered the widely held belief that India is not ready to adopt advanced technologies.  Today, I can say with utmost confidence that India will play a leading role in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  To further extend our global leadership in connectivity, Jio is now rolling out a high-speed, low-latency optic fiber network to more than 50 million homes and premises across 2000 towns and cities in India.  Simultaneously, we are preparing for rolling out 5G services across India.  And Jio Platforms, our digital solutions arm with its growing portfolio of over 20 start-up has built significant capabilities in areas like Cloud and Edge Computing, Big Data Analytics, AI &amp;amp;amp; Machine Learning, Blockchain, AR/ VR and IoT.  Using these technologies, Jio Platforms is in the process of creating compelling solutions for multiple industry verticals and ecosystems spanning Telecom, Media and Entertainment, New Commerce, Financial Services, Education, Healthcare and Agriculture.  We believe that these will have a transformative effect on the social, economic and full development of India.  This is just the beginning for India.  Each of these solutions, once perfected in India and proven at India-scale will be well positioned to address similar needs in other parts of the world.  Clearly, exciting times lie ahead for India and Indians.  Friends,  The Fourth Industrial Revolution has presented us a unique opportunity to create unprecedented value and prosperity for everyone in all spheres of life.  We must invest in building next-generation technology assets.  We must root out inefficiencies across the digital physical ecosystem.  We must break silos and forge winning partnerships.  Only then can we build and sustain a truly digital society.  Jio has been founded on these very values.  It has been conceived not as a business, but as a digital movement.  It is on a mission of making Digital Life a reality for 1.3 billion Indians,  It is on a mission of creating digital platforms upon which 1.3 billion dreams will thrive and flourish.  It is committed to playing a leading role in India's transformation into a DIGITAL SOCIETY and one of the leading digital economies in the world.  It will continue to dream big, and march towards its goals with audacity and fervour.  Because&hellip; for those who dare to dream, there is a whole new world to win.  Thank you very much ladies &amp;amp;amp; gentlemen and my warmest wishes for a productive virtual conference ahead.

","Reliance Life Sciences has developed an RT-PCR kit that promises diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in about 2 hours, company sources said. At present, COVID-19 RT-PCR test, which is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, takes up to 24 hours to give a diagnosis.  The sources said computational biologists at Reliance Life Sciences, a subsidiary of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries Ltd, analysed more than 100 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 sequenced in India and designed unique RT-PCR primers for developing quantitative-Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) kit for COVID-19 detection. RT-PCR kit is so far considered as Gold standard.  The kit, developed by scientists at Reliance Life Sciences, is named R-Green Kit (SARS COV2-real-time PCR) and has been technically validated by ICMR for satisfactory performance, the sources said. ICMR's validation process does not approve/disapprove the kit design as well as it does not certify user-friendliness.  The sources said the kit can detect the presence of E-gene, R-gene, RdRp gene of SARS COV2 virus with Actin as an internal control. As per ICMR results, the kit shows 98.7 percent sensitivity and 98.8 percent specificity.  This kit is a complete indigenous development by the R&amp;amp;amp;D scientists working at the firm, they said, adding one biggest advantage of this kit is that it is simple to use and uses readily available simple reagents and primers which can be synthesised in India. The diagnosis time is approximately 2 hours, they added.  A separate study by Reliance Life Sciences has indicated that the death rate for COVID-19 pandemic may significantly reduce by the end of 2020. The study showed mutation occurrence of structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 form more than 7,000 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 virus from 49 countries.  Statistical analysis showed an inverse correlation between the mutation rates of two proteins NSP6 and Surface glycoprotein (S) with the death rate, according to the study published in the Scientific Journal of Biology. It has been predicted that mutations of these two proteins will grow constantly, while the death rate would drop below 0.5 percent by end of 2020 in cluster I countries (India and Bangladesh).  In the study, it has been observed that the cluster II country (USA) mutation rate of NSP6 and S proteins are lower than cluster I and cluster III (Australia and NZ) countries. Therefore, it has been proposed that in cluster II country the death rate of COVID-19 pandemic will weaken later than cluster I and III countries, the study says.  Reliance also got a US patent for genetically modified microalgae that is said to defend/delay death. The United States Patent on September 8 issued the patent.

The deal is being seen as coming together of a future digital giant and a retail goliath popularly known to be the veteran of the consumer story in India.  &amp;quot;Future brings with it brands where the business models have been established over the years, a strong supply chain and a robust understanding of the Indian consumer segment. They are the pioneers who introduced the Indian common man to multi-storied hypermarkets. The ability to service the aspirations of the common man is what Future had successfully done all these years. This with the new digital ways of life powered by Reliance can create a powerful consumer ecosystem,&amp;quot; said Sreedhar Prasad, an independent e-commerce analyst.  With this deal, Future brings on table Big Bazaar, Fashion at Big Bazaar, EasyDay and Brand Factory. The deal is likely to provide Reliance Retail an additional store strength of around 18,000 across grocery and lifestyle segments.  The deal comes at a time when world over the retailers are struggling to cope up with the decline in business and the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Things became worse for Future which had been in bad financial health since the last few years. The company had a debt of Rs 12,778 crore as of September 2019, a significant increase from Rs 10,951, six months ago.  Reliance has agreed to take up the group's debt as part of the deal.  The retail market is still primarily served by the conventional brick-and-mortar stores which account for over 88 percent of the total market. The organised retail is pegged at $60 billion which is expected to witness a rise of 22-25&nbsp;percent with a market size of $140-160 billion by 2021, according to recent industry reports.  This growth is expected to be driven by economic and socio-demographic factors like growth in income, rise in nuclear families and urbanisation.  This happens at a time when even the e-tailing industry is also witnessing a massive surge. The sector which was expected to cross $200 billion by 2026 is only going to see the numbers multiply given the uptake of e-commerce as a platform in the post-pandemic scenario.  With the two companies combined together, the majority of the market share of the organised retail will fall in their kitty.  The deal is also expected to give firepower to Reliance when it fights Amazon in the grocery segment. &amp;quot;In grocery, you need small locations from where you can pick items and deliver to consumers. Some companies do it with dark stores, some do it by partnering with third-party outlets. But when you have your own store and can see what kind of inventory you have you are in a very powerful position,&amp;quot; said Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst at Forrester Research.  Interestingly, Future was also reported to be in talks for a stake sale with Amazon. Amazon also already holds a 49 percent stake in a vertical called Future Coupons of the group as per a deal which was signed last year, giving Amazon around 3-4 percent stake in Future Retail.  Currently, it allows Amazon India to be the authorised online sales channel for Future's products.

The products can be bought in large quantities and sold at competitive prices, and would see further improvement in margins due to improving scale.","The numbers were already mind-boggling.  Reliance Retail is India&rsquo;s largest, most profitable retail business and is the fastest-growing retailer in the world thus far.  Its revenues are higher than the rest of the organised retailers combined.  Reliance Retail&rsquo;s business footprint spans across 11,806 retail stores in over 7,000 towns with 28.7 million sq ft of retail space.  It sells more fruits and vegetables than any of its peers. It sells more flour and oil, it sells more television, more washing machines, and more clothes.  Despite these fantastic sounding numbers that it has achieved in the 14 years since its launch, there are still some missing pieces to the retail ambitions of Chairman Mukesh Ambani.  Much of its revenue comes from consumer electronics segment. It makes up for almost 75 percent of the outlets, and about 25 percent of the revenue.  But its presence in other big segments, including groceries and fashion and lifestyle, is less intimidating.  With a total count of 800 stores, the grocery segment constitutes less than 10 percent of the stores, and 20 percent of sales.  Of all its retail stores, fashion and lifestyle retail contribute only 20 percent, but in terms of total sales&nbsp;it contributes 8 percent&nbsp;which is around&nbsp;Rs 13,500&nbsp;crore.  Even in fruits and vegetables, the unorganized segment takes over 25 percent of the total pie.  That is where the deal with Future will help Ambani get closer to his vision for the retail business.  The mega transaction with a combined value of Rs 24,713 crore cements the position of Reliance Retail as the undisputed leader in the organised retail segment and adds muscle to the ongoing battle with Amazon for the Indian e-commerce market.  &ldquo;Food and grocery retail is a fragmented market, so the acquisition is more of a consolidation of market share rather than establishing leadership. Reliance Retail is by far the largest retailer already, and the takeover of Future Group's retail assets is more of a consolidation of its leadership position,&rdquo; said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive of retail consultancy firm Third Eyesight.  In the last 4-5 months of lockdown, neighbourhood stores have done well, while large-format stores have lost ground. In the coming months, it will be important to see how Reliance bridges the gap with neighbourhood stores and expands its market reach using its digital footprint,&rdquo; he added.  According to Euromonitor, India&rsquo;s retail market size is about $635 billion (Rs 42 lakh crore) that is split 59:41 between grocery and other categories such as apparel, footwear and electronics.  What falls under Reliance Retail?  Reliance Retail, which was started in 2006, is the retail initiative of the group and is central to the consumer facing businesses.  Reliance Retail has adopted a multi-pronged strategy and operates chain of neighbourhood stores, supermarkets, wholesale cash and carry stores, specialty stores and online stores and has democratized access to a variety of products and services across diverse segments for Indian consumers.  Serving the food and grocery category, Reliance Retail operates Reliance Fresh, Reliance Smart and Reliance Market stores.  In the consumer electronics category, Reliance Retail operates Reliance Digital, Reliance Digital Express Mini stores and Jio stores, and in fashion &amp;amp;amp; lifestyle category, it operates Reliance Trends, Trends Women, Trends Man, Trends junior, Project Eve, Reliance Footprint, Reliance Jewels and AJIO.com, in addition to a large number of partner brand stores across the country.  What falls under merged Future Enterprises?  FRL is engaged mainly in the home and electronics retailing, value retailing and operates Big Bazaar, Easyday, and Foodhall, among other format retail stores. The deal will also involve Future Consumer, which operates the food business, and has significant links with FRL, which is its largest customer, accounting for almost 80 percent of its annual sales.  Future Lifestyle Fashions&nbsp;(FLF) was the flagship fashion business of Future Group. It so far operated in more than 400 stores in 90+ cities, occupying 5.7 mn sq ft of retail space. It ran in-house retail chains Central and Brand Factory, exclusive brand outlets (EBOs) and other multi-brand outlets (MBOs).  Similarly,&nbsp;Future Supply Chain Solutions&nbsp;provides supply-chain solutions [for non-agro products] to Future Group companies as well as to outside companies. The supply-chain company gets 65 percent of its business from FRL.  Large becomes larger  Reliance Retail, which was already the largest retailer in India by a long shot, gets even larger and bigger.  Its network gets a big push in the cities, where&nbsp;40 percent of Future stores are present. In comparison, more than two-thirds of Reliance Retail&rsquo;s nearly 12,000 stores are operating in Tier II, III and IV towns.  The company can now pick and choose which of Future&rsquo;s stores to retain and rationalize the network.  Much of the businesses will be integrated, and that will include the grocery business under Reliance Fresh, and the fashion vertical under the banner of Reliance Trends.  Reliance Retail will get the benefit of economies of scale. The products can be bought in large quantities and sold at competitive prices, and would see further improvement in margins due to improving scale.  The deal will help strengthen the vision created through the launch of JioMart, the online grocery delivery service that propels the company&rsquo;s omni-channel plans. JioMart, which is currently available only at selective cities, will now be able expand its reach.  To meet customer's requirements for essentials, the beta version of the JioMart grocery consumer platform (jiomart.com) was launched across 200 cities, followed by an app later on.  Within a few weeks of launch, JioMart was delivering over 4 lakh orders daily, which according to&nbsp;Reliance Industries&nbsp;(RIL) is significantly higher than any other grocery home delivery company.  JioMart, which went live in May, that saw an order flow four times that of the pre-lockdown period for partner kiranas, pointing to the potential an online-offline network has for stakeholders  Reliance Retail will ensure last-mile connectivity through tie-ups with Kirana stores in the remote region of the country. This ensures formalization of the retail sector as a whole.  Growth in retail will complement Jio&rsquo;s growth because both are consumer-centric.  The deal will help RIL&rsquo;s retail business to expand its offline retail presence and get it ready to tap O2O and B2B opportunities. With Reliance Retail having only begun its digital commerce business (JioMart&rsquo;s&nbsp;online grocery delivery business and the&nbsp;Kirana&nbsp;B2B distribution business), brokerage houses believe value creation from this business will happen only over the medium term.  What now?  After attracting a series of marquee investors to back Jio Platforms, Reliance Industries&rsquo; telecom arm, Chairman Mukesh Ambani, addressing the company&rsquo;s 43rd Annual General Meeting on July 15, indicated that the group&rsquo;s retail venture, too, has received strong interest from strategic and financial investors and plans are underway to induct some in the next few quarters.  The bar has been set high by Jio, which saw 14 deals to sell a 33 percent stake in Jio Platforms (JPL). This, together with the stake sale in the fuel joint venture and a rights issue, will help RIL raise Rs 2.1 trillion ($28 billion), and become net-debt free.  With the Future deal shoring up Reliance Retail numbers and domination in the Indian retail landscape, it may be now time for the next step.

The investment values Reliance Retail at a pre-money equity value of Rs 4.21 lakh crore.  Not very long ago, Reliance Industries (RIL) acquired a minority stake in the Kishore Biyani-led Future Group, through its subsidiary Reliance Retail.  As we speak about the deal, here's all you need to know about how RIL, which once focussed on petrochemicals and oil and gas, entered the consumer business, and what it holds for the conglomerate now.  How it all began  RIL entered the organised retail segment in 2006. This was around the time that RIL was being divided between the brothers Mukesh and Anil Ambani. Christened Reliance Retail, the company started off with the launch of the first Reliance Fresh store in Hyderabad. The idea was to make buying groceries and vegetables a lifestyle experience at neighbourhood market prices. With an investment of Rs 25,000 crore, RIL's aim was to roll out this format for segments such as consumer durables, pharmacy and lifestyle products as well.  Going beyond Reliance Fresh  Reliance gradually widened its horizon across segments such as electronics, fashion and the cash-and-carry businesses. While Reliance Digital, the consumer electronic retail chain was launched in 2007, the company ventured into fashion and the wholesale cash-n-carry segments in 2008 and 2011, respectively, through Reliance Trends and Reliance Market. By 2011, Reliance Retail had achieved $1 billion in sales.  Growth of the giant  By 2014, Reliance became the largest retailer, surpassing Future Group in terms of revenue. Future Group's overall retail revenues totalled up to Rs 13,666 crore on an annualised basis for the financial year ended March 2014, at a time when Reliance Retail's revenue had shot up to Rs 14,496 crore.  Around the same time, Reliance tried to test the e-commerce space with the launch of an online grocery store, reliancefreshdirect.com to deliver groceries in Mumbai. In 2016, it made a full-fledged entry into e-commerce with the launch of curated fashion platform ajio.com. The online commerce space had already heated up with millions of dollars of venture capital money flowing into India.  Reliance was not the only offline retailer looking for an online presence. Aditya Birla Group had also launched its fashion portal, called abof.com, and Shoppers Stop had tied up with Snapdeal to open its online store. All of these companies were competing with the likes of Myntra, which had been acquired by Flipkart two years earlier.  In September 2016, RIL launched its telecom service, Jio, announcing free telecom services till at least that December. This would go a long way in shaping up how the internet was consumed in India. Meanwhile, Reliance Retail continued to grow. It notched up $10 billion in revenue in 2018.  Mergers and Acquisitions  The company went international with the acquisition of British Toy retailer Hamleys in 2019. Earlier this month, it also made a majority acquisition in online pharma company Netmeds for around Rs 620 crore and will take on the likes of Amazon and Flipkart in the segment.  Reliance Retail also has a portfolio of 46 exclusive international partner brands in the luxury segment, including the likes of Armani and Burberry.  Weathering the Covid storm  As with other retailers, Reliance Retail's numbers, too, were hit by the pandemic. Compared to the same period a year ago, Reliance Retail&rsquo;s revenue declined 17 percent to Rs 31,663 crore during the quarter ended June 30. The company reported a net profit of Rs 431 crore despite 50 percent of its stores being fully shut and 29 percent operating partially.  Growth of JioMart  Reliance Retail's online consumer grocery platform JioMart, which was launched in April, has become immensely popular. With over 10 lakh downloads, it is behind only Amazon and Flipkart in terms of app downloads.  JioMart currently offers groceries and other essentials and plans to introduce new categories, including electronics and fashion. It is learnt to be currently receiving 2.5 lakh daily orders from 200 locations across India.

Have old-economy companies had enough of Indian cricket?,The last time two big corporate entities jostled for the official jersey rights was in 2010 when Sahara secured the rights by paying Rs 3.34 crore compared to Airtel's Rs 2.89 crore per international game offer.,"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the richest cricketing body in the world and the game&rsquo;s roaring popularity has meant that it has seldom found itself on a sticky wicket on the financial front.  But, if the bidders for the recently-concluded IPL title sponsorship bids are seen as any indication, it can be seen that none of the old-economy companies explored the prospect of associating with the most popular T20 tournament in the world.  Dream11, Unacademy and Byju's were the three entities which submitted bids while Tata Sons, which had evinced interest, did not place a bid, much to the BCCI&rsquo;s chagrin.  Tata Sons and BCCI could not come to an agreement over the number of categories available for sponsorship. The fact that it was the only old-economy to confirm its interest in the rights shows the dwindling interest of the corporate houses and the emergence of startups and new-age companies in the cricket ecosystem.  Before Vivo, the IPL was sponsored by leading brands such as DLF and Pepsi while the Indian cricket team's official jersey sponsorship rights were held by the likes of ITC and Sahara. Star India also held the rights for three years.  The last time two big corporate entities jostled for the official jersey rights was in 2010 when Sahara secured the rights by paying Rs 3.34 crore compared to Airtel's Rs 2.89 crore per international game offer.  Corporate India's big foray into cricket board sponsorship came in 1987 when Reliance Industries became the title sponsor of the World Cup, which was being held outside England for the first time.  Other companies like Hero MotoCorp and Reliance Communications have also been associated with the International Cricket Council as commercial partners.  In 2019, Byju's replaced Oppo as the jersey sponsor, thus sending a signal that the startups are willing to splash the cash to catch the eyeballs.  Also Read: IPL 2020 | How Dream11 fended off Chinese connection concerns to clinch title sponsorship rights   But, in the past few years, the BCCI has not seen many top companies lining up to bid for the jersey or title sponsorship rights.  In 2017, when Star's contract with BCCI was coming to an end and bids were called, two Chinese handset manufacturers were in the fray &ndash; Oppo and Vivo. Oppo offered to pay Rs 1,079 crore, almost double the BCCI's reserve price of Rs 538 crore.  In 2019, Paytm bagged the BCCI title sponsorship rights until 2023 for Rs 326.8 crore.    &amp;quot;It is not just Indian companies, even MNCs such as Pepsi, Samsung, Coca-Cola, Vodafone and Nike have been steadily showing declining interest. Whether it is value perception only or combined with an indifferent attitude of cricket administrators towards sponsors that is keeping them away, is tough to say,&amp;quot; Harish Thawani, founder of Nimbus Communications, told Moneycontrol.  Thawani said apart from new-age brands like Paytm, Byju&rsquo;s and Dream11, the rest simply cannot afford the investment in cricket.  Also Read | Dream11 wins IPL title sponsorship: Here's how big is the fantasy sports gaming market in India   &amp;quot;The landscape changes every few years. It was dominated by Pepsi, LG, Samsung, Hero MotoCorp, Vodafone and Airtel Now, the Chinese brands and some new-age brands are dominating. Two years from now, there will be others,&amp;quot; he said.  Saurabh Uboweja, Managing Partner of managing consulting firm BOD Consulting, feels the cricket sponsorship segment is following the worldwide trend of brands catering to youngsters garnering the bulk of sports sponsorship deals.  &amp;quot;The new-age companies follow the new trends. If you look at the digital gaming segment, it is massive and it makes sense for Dream11 to bid for the rights. Earlier, it used to be the likes of Oppo and Vivo, which used to target the new-age customers. Whenever brands take sponsorship of sports events, they look at the target audience. Earlier, Pepsi and Coca-Cola used to heavily sponsor cricket tournaments but of late due to people&rsquo;s perception of cola-based drinks, they have stopped spending heavily in that segment. A brand like Amul is now trying to reinvent itself and has focused a lot on sports sponsorships. A brand which is already young in terms of image will always try to go all out in terms of associating with sports properties,&amp;quot; he told Moneycontrol.  Jagdeep Kapoor, brand guru and Chairman and Managing Director, Samsika Marketing Consultants, said the big Indian companies have missed a golden chance of propelling their brands opportunity by passing up the opportunity to associate with this year's IPL.  &amp;quot;Big Indian companies missed a great opportunity as IPL is a great property. In brand building and sponsorship, companies need to have a long-term view. The traditional companies have a vision but they are going for revision and slashing their marketing budgets. You can&rsquo;t be cutting your nose to spite the face. Dream11 has got a goldmine and is a good move from their point of view. According to me, the established players have missed out on a great opportunity,&amp;quot; he told Moneycontrol.  With COVID-19 putting a dent on the finances of India Inc, it was widely speculated that the BCCI would have a tough time in getting a deal similar to the one they had inked with Vivo. Ultimately, Dream11 has offered to pay Rs 222 crore for this year and the cricket board will have to look for associate sponsorship slots to reduce the deficit.  So, has the BCCI been able to salvage the situation vis-a-vis the IPL sponsorship?  &amp;quot;In the pandemic affected market, to get 50 percent of what Vivo was paying is a reasonable result. But one hears other central sponsors have pulled out too. So, let's see how that pans out,&amp;quot; said Thawani.

The deal values Netmeds around Rs 1,000 crore.  The acquisition gives RIL&rsquo;s retail unit Reliance Retail entry into a vertical e-commerce space, one of the few that has soared during the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to its online grocery platform JioMart.  Founded by Pradeep Dadha, Netmeds currently delivers medicines, personal and baby care items, and provides doctor bookings and diagnostics on its website and app. It has been looking for a buyer for nearly a year now, after it was unable to raise a large round of funding.  Its investors include Singapore-based Daun Penh Cambodia Group, Sistema Asia Fund, Tanncam Investment and healthcare-focused investment firm OrbiMed.  Listen: Setting Sail podcast | Wow Momo may cut jobs in September, business still not back to pre-Covid level: Sagar Daryani  Isha Ambani,&nbsp; Director, Reliance Retail Ventures, said in a statement, &ldquo;The addition of Netmeds enhances Reliance Retail&rsquo;s ability to provide good&nbsp; quality and affordable healthcare products and services, and also broadens its digital&nbsp; commerce proposition to include most daily essential needs of consumers.&rdquo;  A scrum of startups have fiercely fought in e-pharmacies for a few years now on the thesis that delivering medicines for chronic illnesses regularly could be a springboard to becoming a large internet company. Netmeds, PharmEasy, Medlife, 1mg, etc have been jostling for space. However, margins in medicine delivery are minimal, and investors will not fund money-losing startups unless they are market leaders.  The pandemic however turned this notion on its head. The segment has benefited from many first-time customers flocking to these apps as they were forced to order medicines from home during lockdown. Moneycontrol reported on August 7 that these apps have seen orders surge 50 percent and taken the sector forward by two years in the last three months.  According to people close to the deal, although RIL was eyeing the sector, and Netmeds, even before the pandemic hit, the lockdown helped close the deal, find the right valuation and proved the business thesis.  Last week, Amazon India rolled out its e-pharmacy service in Bengaluru, with plans to launch in the rest of the country soon.  The entry of these conglomerates, to some extent, gives the sector long-term prospects. Barring PharmEasy, every other startup in the sector has been battling for survival, struggling to raise funds and been eyeing mergers with larger rivals.  &ldquo;It is a good outcome for both sides. Netmeds needed to survive and find a home. RIL wanted to enter the sector, but not pay a very high tech-style valuation,&rdquo; said an investor in the space, requesting anonymity.  The deal fuels Jio&rsquo;s desire to have a full-fledged ecommerce platform, delivering goods of all kinds. Acquiring distressed startups has been a step in this direction. It is reportedly in talks to acquire online furniture startup Urban Ladder, online lingerie retailer Zivame and online milk delivery startup Milkbasket.

The deal was to close by March but has been delayed","Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil exporter, is conducting due diligence to acquire $15 billion stake in Reliance Industries' refining and petrochemical business, its CEO Amin Nasser said.  Billionaire Mukesh Ambani had in August last year announced plans to sell a 20 percent stake in RIL's oil-to-chemical (O2C) business to Aramco,&nbsp;at a valuation of $75 billion. The deal was to close by March but has been delayed.  &amp;quot;With regard to the Reliance deal, all I can say at this stage (is that) it's going through the due diligence,&amp;quot; Nasser said in June quarter earnings call with investors.  &amp;quot;So, depending on the due diligence, we will make our decision after we complete the due diligence on that deal.&amp;quot;  According to the transcript of the investor call, he went on to state that the deal to buy a stake in the world's largest single-location oil refining complex and India's biggest petrochemical assets &amp;quot;is a big deal. So, we need to take our time to review and then decide based on the outcome of the due diligence study&amp;quot;.  Ambani had at RIL's annual general meeting last month stated that the Aramco deal had been delayed &amp;quot;due to unforeseen circumstances in the energy market and the COVID-19 situation&amp;quot;.  He neither said if the deal was on track nor gave any fresh timelines for its completion. Nasser too did not give timelines for completion of the deal saying discussions with Reliance were still on and shareholders will be updated &amp;quot;in due course&amp;quot;.  RIL's O2C business comprises of the company's twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat, petrochemical plants, and 51 percent in fuel retailing venture. The deal may have been delayed over valuations, sources said.  Last month after RIL's AGM, Bernstein had stated that: &amp;quot;The sell-down of a 20 percent stake in the refinery and chemical business to Aramco for $15 billion has not progressed as planned, given changes in market conditions. We believe a deal is still possible although at a lower valuation, closer to our estimate of $57 billion gross&amp;quot;.  To facilitate the deal, Reliance had earlier this year decided to spin off the O2C business into a separate subsidiary, and Ambani last month said that process is likely to be completed by early 2021.  But for him, the urgency of the Aramco deal has diminished after RIL amassed over Rs 2.12 lakh crore from sale of nearly 33 percent stake in the conglomerate's digital arm Jio Platforms, rights issue and selling 49 percent stake in fuel retail business to BP.  This money helped the oil-telecom-to-retail conglomerate to become a zero net debt company nine months ahead of the target.  &amp;quot;Our equity requirements have already been met,&amp;quot; Ambani had said in the AGM. With a stake, Aramco would not just have a share in one of the world's best refineries and the largest integrated petrochemical complex but also access to one of the fastest-growing markets -- a ready-made market for 5 lakh barrels per day of its Arabian crude and a potentially bigger downstream role in future.  It will make the world's biggest crude exporter join the ranks of the top oil refiners and chemical makers, and help it reach its goal of more than doubling refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million barrels a day.  Last week, BofA Securities in a report said with the Saudi Aramco deal, &amp;quot;RIL will be able to better utilise its refinery capabilities with availability of several grades of crude oil from super light to heavy being supplied by Aramco&amp;quot;.  The partnership going ahead will leverage the O2C value chain to maximise margins and meet the evolving needs of consumers by supplying energy, base chemicals and new materials.  The strategic partnership with Aramco will help in increasing its crude oil to chemicals conversion ratio, which presently stands at 20 per cent. &amp;quot;With the deal, RIL will get technological expertise from SABIC (Saudi Basic Industries Corporation), in which Aramco recently bought a controlling stake,&amp;quot; it had said.  For Aramco, it creates a long-term crude supply contract of 0.5 million barrels per day (about 5 percent of current production) to RIL's Jamnagar refinery, with reduced demand risks. Aramco currently covers only about 40 percent of its crude output via refining and strives to increase it further.  &amp;quot;It would give Aramco the opportunity to participate in Indian market growth story where demand will likely be strong over the next two decades,&amp;quot; it added.
